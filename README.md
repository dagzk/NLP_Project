# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

As an avid reader, I get many recommendations from my circle regarding which books I should read. Having heard of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, I decided to use NLP to get a feeling based of people's reviews concerning his Incerto (consisting of 5 books) and possibly the topics within.

NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.
