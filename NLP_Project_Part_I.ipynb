    "As an avid reader, I get many recommendations from my circle regarding which books I should read next. Having heard different opinions of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, I decided to use NLP to get a feeling based of people's reviews concerning his Incerto (consisting of 5 books) and possibly the topics within. I will divide this project into multiple Notebooks to make it easier to read.\n",

I’ve just checked and most of the other reviews of this book do pretty much what I thought they would do. They complain about the tone. This guy is never going to win an award for modesty and he probably thinks you are stupid and have wasted your life. And it gets worse – like that quote from Oscar Wilde that has tormented me for years: “Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do”, this guy reckons that if you work for more than an hour or so per day you are probably too stupid to know (or deserve) any better.Do you hate him yet? I didn’t. I found him very amusing. Admittedly, I probably wouldn’t want to be stuck beside him on a long flight somewhere – but I don’t really go on long flights anywhere, so it doesn’t make too much sense using that as a criterion for anything.Let’s make a proper start. I’m going to tell you something about Heraclitus. Probably best known for some pithy little quotes about change that he made up all by himself a very long time ago. “You can never stand in the same river twice” – “All is flux”. Heraclitus’s vision of the world was that what is important is change, everything else is transitory and impermanent. Bertrand Russell claims that Heraclitus came from an aristocratic family that ended up dashed agains the rocks of change and not nearly so well off. The other thing you might need to know about Heraclitus was that he was known as ‘The Obscure’.I was reminded constantly of Heraclitus while reading this book. The author was also from a well off family that lost everything in the Lebanese War. This also made him focus on change and the nature of unpredictable events. Hardly surprising then that Popper is his favourite philosopher – there is no ultimate truth, rationality is more or less prejudice, everything is awaiting falsification.I have a love/hate relationship with Karl Popper. I can never work out if he is incredibly naïve (as Taleb proudly boasts that he is) or if he is terribly profound. I do like his idea that we should constantly seek to prove our most beloved theories wrong – but I also think that this level of scepticism is somewhat overstated. There is a line in this book in which we are informed (well, twice actually) that Newton was proven wrong by Einstein. Oh, was he just? I guess all those people shot through the head by guns aimed after the careful application of Newton’s laws of motion suddenly came back to life again then did they? I guess Neil Armstrong, who got to the moon on Newtonian physics, not on the front seat of one of Einstein’s light rays, might also have been a bit surprised at this remarkable over-throw.Okay, I know, I’m nitpicking, but then again, Taleb does ask for it. He is so contemptuous of the ignorance and foolishness of others that it does become a bit of a sport for him. The one thing you can say about Taleb is that he is not like Heraclitus when it comes to being obscure. He is always very clear, very comprehensive and very interesting.We should now do some of the people he particularly hates. And in the first rank of those he hates are probably Journalists. Now, it is hard not to agree with him there. He sees Journalism as basically part of the entertainment industry and believes they only really go ‘wrong’ when they start to think they serve some purpose beyond entertainment. Then there are business people, who he believes are mostly thick. One of the main contentions of his book is that successful people are often successful by pure chance. As such their abiding emotion should be gratitude. However, as he repeatedly points out, we all tend to believe our successes are proof of our own genius, and that it is only our failings that are the result of bad luck and chance.This book gives a wonderful introduction to many of the fallacies we humans are all too prone to make. He makes a cogent argument that we can never be ‘purely rational’ because we need our emotions to short-circuit the endless decision loop that each ‘purely rational’ decision would involve. This book is also a great introduction to probability theory without too many numbers – to the theory without the calculus. Some of his verbal explanations of mistakes are remarkably clear – so clear they virtually jump from the page.One of the constant themes that I found particularly interesting was that we all suffer from hindsight bias. This is something I will definitely be taking from this book. The idea is that because what has happened in the past has ‘happened’ we think it is the only thing that could have happened and then use it to predict what will happen in the future. We forget that events in the past were also the culmination of probabilistic situations that have resolved one way and not another. We forget that these events could just as easily have resolved in another equally probable outcome - one that merely did not occur. The range of fallacies that he shows spring from this one bias is quite remarkable.Now, I was recommended this book by someone called Yuri and the funniest story in the book also starred someone called Yuri. It is when he is discussing Stock Market people applying for jobs with him. One of the things they tend to put on their CVs is that they play chess. They do this because playing chess means they are both ‘analytical’ and ‘strategic’. These are obviously good things to be - in fact, I think I would like to be both of these things. Since you can be both of these things just by declaring yourself to be them, we shall take it as read from now on that I am both of these. Taleb tends to prefer to associate with Russian Physicists, not just because they think like him, but also because they can give him lessons in chess and teach him to play piano. When one of these new stock market trader types applies for a job and says that they play chess – Taleb brings this up and then says, “And this is Yuri who will now continue the interview”. And here Yuri appears with a chess board in front of him…I once watched a Russian playing a non-Russian at chess. The Russian spent the entire time laughing his head off after every move. I don't know if it was because the moves made by his opponent were so useless that he truly found them funny or because this was all part of the psychological warfare - but he did slaughter his non-Russian opponent, so perhaps a bit of both.This is another book inspired by behavioural economics (like Freakonomics and Predictably Irrational - I'm becoming a bit of a fan of behavioural economics.If you take this book in good humour, if you allow yourself to listen and not get worked up about his ‘inappropriate tone’ (god save us from those who complain about inappropriate tone) you will learn something from this book and maybe even have a good time.And I can do a two word review of this book - Shit Happens!\\n...more\\n\\n\",\n",

Taleb goes to great lengths to point out how some of the original assumptions made in investments and finance have blown up in people’s faces. Yes, unusual events do happen more often than a normal distribution suggests. Yes, relationships among securities can change in meltdown scenarios. And yes, people are regularly fooled into thinking luck is skill. However, some market participants are clear-sighted enough to see those shrouded risks for what they are and make better assumptions about how they should be traded off against expected returns. These more enlightened investors don’t get the print, though, since they’re not the straw men Taleb can knock down.Don’t get me wrong. We all like debunking stodgy, established wisdom when we see the holes. If you’re like Taleb, though, and see only holes, what you’re left with is nothing. What might there be in its place? Some models, when tweaked, are still useful.In a brief moment of modesty, Taleb confesses to psychological weaknesses that can lead him to mistake noise for signal. He seems rather smug about it all, though. It’s like he figures his ability to recognize himself as a fool puts him on a higher plane. For the most part, his ego is openly displayed. It’s also coupled with an axe to grind – an aggressive combination. His fund has consistently underperformed (though he would counter that he’s positioned just right for the coming holocaust). His investment strategy boils down to buying lots and lots of insurance contracts against rare occurrences that he thinks will be slightly less rare. (In actuality, he buys stock options, but the insurance metaphor illustrates the point.) The problem is he’s so firm in his belief that the insurance companies have underestimated risks that he thinks all premiums are too low. However, those selling options, armed with models that account for rare events appropriately, will charge more than enough to cover those risks.Who will be fortune’s fool? Time will tell, but a provocateur like Taleb will in all probability be better known for his quasi-epistemological exposition on unanticipated variability than for any true investment success.\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

And as I read I had the growing feeling that the book could have been conveniently summarised in a dozen and a half bullet points with a few anecdotes tacked on for amusement. This naturally led me to resent both the time I spent reading it and the author for stretching a good magazine article into book length.What the author has to say is interesting (view spoiler)[ at least at first, after a few repetitions it starts to get a bit stale (hide spoiler)] and it has to be said that skill is required to repeat your ideas repetitively in repetition and to repeatedly stretch repetitively those repeated ideas that would have been enough for a ten or fifteen page article repetitively over three hundred plus pages of repetition. Having said that I did have a warm feeling of Schadenfreude at the plight of the broker who lost everything and was last seen in his string vest smoking a cigarette to death as his few unreprocessed chattels were loaded on to the back of a very small van.The notion of the black swan sums up his argument ie until Europeans arrived in Australia none of them had any idea that there was such a thing as a black swan. In the same way in the markets, or more generally in any activity, you can't calculate the risk or probability of an event if it's never happened - or as in the case of a black swan, if you can't even conceive of the very possibility of the event, the kind of things famously described by Donald Rumsfeld as the 'unknown unknowns'.Reading one gets the impression that Taleb is modestly impressed by his own brilliance, one could well believe that he talks about himself in the third person like Caesar in Asterix, and that he is something of what might be technically described as an arsehole.Borrow don't buy.

He talks about how, for instance, in an upscale neighborhood a janitor who won the lottery may live next to a dentist. Many of us take this information and attribute the likelihood for success as a janitor and a dentist to be closer than it actually is. But being a janitor provides an individual with an opportunity set, with, say a 1% chance of having a high standard of living and a 99% chance of having a low standard living. The dentist opportunity set may be 95% for high standard of living and 5% for low standard of living. But if there are many more janitors than dentists and you live in an upscale neighborhood (where you only see the survivors), that relationship becomes muddled.Anyway, if you believe the preceding ideas, the book doesn\\'t offer much else.\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

I actually digested more from the rereading than I did from the initial reading (and I digested quite a bit from the first reading). Both times, I focused on reading the book very, very slowly. Obviously, the fact that I spent the time to reread this book is indicative of how valuable I think it is.Known for his great wit, the baseball pitcher Vernon Louis “Lefty” Gomez was fond of saying that, “I’d rather be lucky than good.” This phrase, in essence, is one of the central themes of the book. Although it sounds like a hackneyed platitude, Gomez, understood the role of randomness in our lives. However, due to myriad biases, we humans often tend to attribute our successes to our skill and blame bad luck for our failures. Is your rich neighbor or your boss really as skilled as she thinks she is?Parts of the book are also about the hindsight bias and the narrative fallacy. We humans are great at fabricating post hoc narratives about our world. It’s how we understand (and misunderstand) the world, but we must remember not to take our stories too seriously. “A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact,” writes Taleb, “but in the light of the information until that point.”One of Taleb’s favorite philosophers is Karl Popper. However, Taleb wasn’t always enthralled with the man who espoused the beauty of empirical falsification. Prior to rediscovering the great philosopher, Taleb went through a self identified anti-intellectual phase early in his career as a trader. He feared becoming a corporate slave with “work ethics” (a term which he interprets to mean inefficient mediocrity). “Philosophy, to me,” Taleb writes, “became something rhetorical people did when they had plenty of time on their hands; it was an activity reserved for those who were not well versed in quantitative methods and other productive things. It was a pastime that should be limited to late hours, in bars around the campuses, when one had a few drinks and a light schedule — provided one forgot the garrulous episode as early as the next day. Too much of it can get a man in trouble, perhaps turn one into a Marxist ideologue.” As they say, the dose determines the poison.Speaking of poison, another interesting idea that Taleb espouses is that being too attached your beliefs is poisonous. As he puts it: “Loyality to ideas is not a good thing for traders, scientists, — or anyone”. I like to think about it this way, there are times we shouldn’t trust experts precisely because they are experts. This is because they are no incentives to be brutally critical of your own ideas. A scientist or a preacher who has built their career on a certain idea obviously has a lot invested in that idea. How likely are they to be critical of their own position when their livelihood depends on it being accepted? What if they are putting out pseudo-scientific nutritional guidelines that cause harm, but help them keep their job?According to Popper there are only two types of theories:1) Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).2) Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.If you accept Popper’s epistemology, like I also do, you can never claim that you know a theory to be true. In other words, we can only gain knowledge through proving that things are false. For instance, when I accidentally find myself in a theistic debate, people often challenge me to tell them how the universe came into existence. When I say ‘I don’t know’, they become infuriated. How dare I have the gall to dismiss some of their religion’s claims as not true without projecting my own claim to reality? Yet, that’s exactly the point. I gain knowledge through knowing what’s wrong, not through making claims about what I think is right.So what should we make of Taleb’s extreme and obsessive Popperism in a more practical sense? How does he recommend we apply to it our lives? I think it can be summarized in the following passage:I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: No rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me. My idea of science diverges with that of the people around me walking around calling themselves scientists. Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.The following thought experiment really helped me internalize this message. Assume you participate in a gambling game that has 999/1000 chance of winning $1 [Event A] and a 1/1000 chance of winning $10,000 [Event B]. Using some straightforward calculations the expectation of a loss is roughly $9 (multiply the probabilities by the outcome for each event and then sum them) Which event would you bet on? I suspect that most people consider the frequency or probability in their decision, but this is totally irrelevant. According to Taleb, even people like MBAs and economists with some statistical training fail to understand this point. The magnitude of the outcome should be the only relevant factor in the decision. Think of a trader who focuses on event B, sure, he is likely to bleed slowly for long periods of time, but when the rare event happens the payoff is astronomical compared to the losses. Most of us, however, are schooled in environments that focus on games with symmetrical outcomes (e.g., a coin toss). The great psychologist and father of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, also reminds us that we are loss averse and psychologically struggle with idea of bleeding out small losses for extended periods of time, even if there is eventually the opportunity for a huge payday.Once you realize that life is full of scenarios with asymmetrical payoffs, you’re thinking (if you’re anything like me anyway) will be permanently altered. In fields like, say, writing, the outcomes are asymmetrical. In other words, there is not a linear relationship with the number of hours spent writing and the amount of income one makes. One may spend a long time writing for free and then finally catch a huge book deal. For me, this is somewhat of a moot point because I’d write for free without any other justification other than the fact that it’s fun and makes me happy. However, if all other things were equal, and I could also make money doing something I love, I would be very happy.Here’s another piece of practical wisdom that I really enjoyed: “stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a tendency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in the league tables.” These are the same kinds of people who think that their GPA reflects their intelligence. Or that the number of hours they spend running on a treadmill reflects their fitness. Or that their inherited wealth says something about their genetic fitness. Or that their expensive clothes make them beautiful. I could continue on and on, but I think you get the point.I often hear those around me complaining about how life will be better when they achieve “X”. Alas, I’m human and guilty of making claims like this on occasion too. The trouble is that, for most of us anyway, we won’t really experience long-term improvements in our happiness when we achieve “X”. Throughout the book, Taleb devotes a fair amount of time alerting readers of what the literature in behavioral economics tells us about our irrational tendencies and biases.For example, there’s the social treadmill effect: you get rich, move to rich neighborhoods, then become poor again once you compare yourself to your new peers. Then, you may work your ass off and get rich again, only to repeat the cycle. If you want to feel worse about yourself, then the best piece of positive advice I know of is to hang around people who are wealthier than you. I often try to remind myself that I’m living a life that is materially better than 99.9% of all humans that have ever existed and yet I still have the audacity to claim that I don’t have enough sometimes. Pathetic.At one point in the book, Taleb writes: “I see no special heroism in accumulating money, particularly if, in addition, the person is foolish enough to not even try to derive any tangible benefit from wealth (aside from the pleasure of regularly counting the beans)”. In other words, money is only valuable if you use it as a tool to extract enjoyment from life.If it isn’t clear, I think he is making reference to the likes of Warren Buffett, whom people tend to see as being virtuous simply for the fact that he has been able to accumulate hordes of money. What I think many people fail to understand is that there is nothing virtuous about having money just for the sake of having it. How someone earned what they have tells you a lot more about them than how much they have. We generally tend to think that having money signals other traits about a person, but I’ll remind you that there is a lot of noise in those signals (think inheritance). Having money doesn’t necessarily signal any superior traits.Those who want to make a lot of money are greedy and shouldn’t try to deny that motivation. Greed, however, is not necessarily a bad thing. As Adam Smith taught us, another mans’ greed can create more wealth for society as a whole (provided the individual’s wealth is ethically obtained).Do cigarette smokers understand probabilities? If so, how can they rationally understand the ills of cigarettes and yet be foolish enough to smoke them anyway? When I go for walks near hospitals I’m always surprised by the number of people in scrubs (perhaps some of whom are doctors and nurses) who I assume are well aware of how harmful cigarettes are, but smoke them anyway. Apparently, intellectually understanding something and being able to put it into practice are two different things.One thing Taleb also writes about is the selection bias in blogging and book reviewing. The cover of my edition of Fooled By Randomness has an excerpt praising Taleb as one of the “hottest thinkers” in the world. While I certainly agree, I couldn’t help but smirk after reading that line — can you say selection bias?Any book that is worth reading twice is worth reading more than twice. When you love a writer, you want to hear his opinion on just about everything.- See more at: http://coffeetheory.com/2010/05/25/bo...\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

Part II would have been pretty good if I hadn't read a lot of other books on the topics, and for those who are interested in economic markets, I think this would interest you if you can move past the constant interjections of Taleb's personal philosophy. Personally, my eyes glaze over when I read about trading, and I much prefer books like The Drunkard's Walk, which illustrates many of the same (but also many more) concepts. I was happy to read the section on Tversky and Kahneman, but I find their work infinitely more interesting and readable than his summary, and you are spared the normative commentary. Ironic for a man who criticises the normative dimensions of economics, Taleb certainly pushes a strong view of the world. When Taleb does delve into intriguing concepts, I was frustrated with the fact that he explained them poorly and incompletely, and quickly moved on to another topic. Much of the anecdote in the book could have been removed to make way for the real substance of the book. I don't really disagree with his criticisms of MBAs, economists, traders, journalists, etc., but I also don't think anything he says is especially revealing of insightful for most of us who aren't involved in the trading world. All in all, I am really puzzled by the popularity of this book, and I would strongly recommend against bothering with this one.

Cliches exist for a reason, but 196 pages later I feel the point has been well made.Taleb is a stock market trader. As a trader, he believes that there is no way in general to predict the stock market -- that there are so many variables that the resulting stock price is indistinguishable from pure noise. Unfortunately, his profession is filled with people who believe that they *can* predict the market. In fact, some of these people trade very successfully for a while. Taleb belives that no trader can stay ahead of the market forever. The success of a small number of traders for a short amount of time can simply be explained by statistics: after all, given a large enough group of traders, some are bound to be successful some of the time even if their trades are entirely random.This point is well illustrated with many examples, and this is where the book falters for me. Some of the examples are great (he goes into a lot of detail about various Monte Carlo simulations he has constructed), but some just seem like strawmen (he goes to a lot of trouble to describe the fancy cars, extravagant house, impulsive trading strategy, and hubris of a hypothetical trader, setting him up for his inevitable fall at the hands of the \"unexpected rare event\").Some examples are just plain wrong, or at least misleading. For example, he goes into detail describing the work of Karl Popper, a philosopher who was interested in the question \"how do you tell the difference between science and non-science?\" Popper proposed several theories of science to answer this question.The first, naive falsificationism, essentially states two things: firstly, that a theory is scientific if it can be falsified; and secondly, that a theory which has been falsified should no longer be used.The second, sophisticated falsificationism, was a response to both the negativity of naive falsificationism and also a response to the criticism that science doesn\\'t work that way (by immediately discarding theories the moment they contradict any evidence). Sophisticated falsificationism again states two things: that a theory is scientific if it leads to the discovery of novel (ie, new) facts; and that a theory is falsified by a new theory if the new theory can accurately predict everything the old theory could but *also* can accurately predict novel facts. General relativity is the canonical example of this: it incorporates Newtonian mechanics at low speeds but also explains things that Newtonian mechanics cannot at near-light speeds.Anyway, Taleb\\'s summary of all of this was \"Popper\\'s detractors called him a naive falsificationist.\" They did not, or at least not disparagingly, because Popper himself proposed the term, and labeled himself accordingly! I can understand why Taleb might not have wanted to include a huge explicative paragraph on Popper, but the book would have been just fine without the dubious example.Another example of sloppiness occurs later, when Taleb talks about the QWERTY keyboard layout as an example of \"the vicious dynamics of winning and losing in an economy\" and repeats the old saw that the QWERTY layout was designed to slow typists down, and that it succeeded anyway because of a \"snowball effect\" of popularity. This claim is highly contentious (in fact one way to both speed typists up and prevent mechanical key jams is to put commonly-used letter combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard, something that QWERTY does to some extent but that Dvorak does much better), and once again the book would have been just fine without it.Taleb is best when he is covering his area of expertise -- probability -- and the chapters dealing with probability are great. There are also several enjoyable and illustrative personal anecdotes which are a fun and memorable read.Overall I enjoyed the book.

In fact, he is clearly impressed by wealth, but counteracts it by stressing how little he works, how much time he devotes to intellectual pursuits and how much smarter he is than the typical wealthy person.

It remains a fascinating book nonetheless.Key ideas: We do not gauge causation, probability and risk very well, and hence we do not act according to a rational model of behavior, a la homo economicus. His heroes are Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky, whom Taleb sees as the greatest thinkers in modern economics, since they re-wrote the book about how we actually decide as opposed to how economists and other rationalists think we ought to decide. Based on their work and that of a host of other researchers in behavioral economics/finance, he catalogs many of the systematic biases that strongly affect our behavior, such as:o\\tHindsight bias: We fit the explanation to the events after the fact, as if we knew it at the time. And, we see patterns where there are none – or we see the wrong pattern. Mistrust the predictions of experts – they will almost always be trumped by an evidence-based analysis, since they tend to mis-remember the past. They remember their successes and forget their failures. o\\tAttribution bias: Beautiful people are more virtuous than ugly people. Tall people are more likely to be leaders than short people. A man in a suit is more trustworthy than a man in t-shirt and jeans. And so on. o\\tSmall number bias: We extrapolate wildly from small samples.o\\tAsymmetric pain/pleasure from losses or gains: The pain of a loss is roughly twice as much as the pleasure from an equivalent-sized gain. So we sell our winners but keep our losers (to avoid having to feel the pain).In short, life is more random than you think and your ability to navigate it rationally is more limited than you think. What do I think of all this? He\\'s right that it\\'s a good idea to keep an open mind and to be ready to change your mind when you come up with a better interpretation and/or a more accurate set of facts. So far, so good. But his core world view is the product of the only profession he\\'s ever known: Wall Street trading. As such, he does not shape let alone control events -- he simply bets on their outcome. That\\'s not the kind of perspective that makes you see the world as a highly deterministic place, or one where, if you hope to survive long enough to get a few gray hairs, you can think of yourself as a \"master of the universe\" or even captain of your ship.

It makes him furious that so many of the idiot journalists out there misunderstand absence of evidence for evidence of absence, and he cites studies where despite numerous subjects no significant benefit can be shown for a medication over placebo treatment. This is not evidence that there is no effect of the medication! he yells, and completely fails to understand the difference between significance and effect size. Yes, it may well come out later that the medication indeed does have an effect. But no, it is not at all likely that that effect will be very relevant, as its size must be tiny or the original study methodically flawed (as otherwise it would have found it).To reiterate, Taleb does not distinguish between significance and effect size in an argument where he calls everyone else a fool for not getting probabilities right. Sums up the book quite nicely.(In addition, it is very annoying when his constant reminding the reader that he is no expert on something does not stop him from talking about it, just from giving any evidence for what he is talking about whatsoever.

I'll leave you with James Clear's excellent three sentence summary:Randomness, chance, and luck influence our lives and our work more than we realize. Because of hindsight bias and survivorship bias, in particular, we tend to forget the many who fail, remember the few who succeed, and then create reasons and patterns for their success even though it was largely random. Mild success can be explainable by skills and hard work, but wild success is usually attributable to variance and luck.\\n...more\\n\\n\",\n",

Desperate, he travels to Lourdes to pray and drink miraculous water. He heals. He says he was healed by the blessed Virgin Mary. A poor, plain-looking dude like Jack Ma toiled and moiled to make a name for himself and get out of the rut he was in. He succeeded and became one of the richest men in the world. He now tours all over delivering lectures on how to achieve success, preaching its secrets he claim to have discovered. A priest is buried then exhumed several years later and his body had not decomposed. He is sainted. An idiot, with his unique brand of idiocy, captures the imagination of his fellow citizens who are mostly idiots like him anyway. So he wins the elections and, perplexed by his victory, credits the hand of God for it. So he starts to implement his idiotic ideas, reasoning out that since God himself put him into office, then God must have approved of his plans, no matter how unquestionably evil they are.There are many such examples. What is hidden, and which causes the deception, are facts like: MILLIONS as sick as the young man, who drank more holy water than him and prayed even more and visited more holy sites were not healed and had died on schedule; MILLIONS who did what Jack Ma had done and followed what he reveals now as secrets to success, achieved no such success and remained poor or middle class; evil leaders had won elections fair and square, slaughtered millions and caused a lot of sufferings which one can hardly attribute to divine providence; terminally ill agnostics and atheists occasionally enjoying spontaneous healing without praying, drinking miraculous water or going into religious pilgrimages. Fairly recently, a wonderfully preserved body of a long deceased soft porn actress was dug up and no one called her an “incorruptible” like the heart of Padre Pio because she was not known to have lived a holy life when she was still alive.This is, more or less, the main thesis of this book. It unashamedly is—“about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). It manifests itself in the shape of the LUCKY FOOL, defined as a person who benefited from a disproportionately share of luck but attributes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason. Such confusion crops up in the most unexpected areas, even science, though not in such an accentuated and obvious manner as it does in the world of business. It is endemic in politics, as it can be encountered in the shahpe of a country’s president discoursing on the jobs that HE created, HIS recovery, and “his predecessor’s” inflation.”I like books like this which make you think and question generally-held beliefs. \\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

It has everything in a book that I yearn for....interesting ideas...some of which I don\\'t grasp because hey are too clever for me...a smug narrator who seemingly knows more than everyone else...and a well-written and pleasing style.Here is the crux of the book. Brokers have a very common weakness. They fail to appreciate that the likelihood of an event can not be the only factor one looks at when deciding to make a move. The likelihood, and the cost of the mistake are both critical.For example. If I told you that you could make $ 100 on every trade for 99/100 times, would you do it? The correct answer, depends on what happens on the other chance. When you are in a market, or some other experience where there are lots of repeated throws of the dice, the rare odd will happen, which is often when you hear of a trader \\'blowing up\\'. When that happens, the greater and powerful \"Master-of-the-Universe\" disappears, and is banished forever...deemed a failure by his peers. What happened, is that he was unaware of the \\'Black Swan\\', the title of another book by the same author.In Europe in the middle ages, because all swans that had been seen were white, it had been postulated that ALL swans were white...a fallacy ultimately disproven when the contrary evidence was eventually found in Australia. In basic logical terms, the absence of B within a data set not proven to be the entire sum does not equal \\'always A\\'.So this \\'Black Swan\\', the one throw out of 100 can and does happen. In the previous example, if you won all the previous 99 throws, you would have earned $9900. That sounds great, until you learn that loosing the final throw costs you $200,000. Knowing those odds, would you play the game? This basic fallacy, the lack of assessing the intensity of the randomness, is what dooms many people who sound well and truly brilliant...right until they blow up and are never heard from again. Of course, there are other brilliant comments on the need to ignore useless and irrelevant noise, and train ourself to recognize that a random fluctuation is just that, and one should not search for a reason for mere statistical chatter, but the analogy of the black swan is the main crux of this wonderfully well-written book. \\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

The author’s most famous exclamation is that the 40 years of investment success experienced by Warren Buffett, \"may be by chance.\" He claims that with the number of investors, it was a statistical certainty that one would obtain Buffett’s success.Obviously, life is full of random events. And some people benefit from occasional windfalls or bonanzas, while others experience tragic accidents. Furthermore, the line between success and failure is often very thin. However, most observant people are able to notice traits that are common to typical people: whether it is successful investors or professional basketball players. Investors may have strong math skills and confidence while professional basketball players may possess incredible athletic ability and be exceptionally tall. People who experience sustained success usually have certain traits (as King Solomon noted over 3,000 years ago. He observed the plans of the diligent led, surely to success, while drunkard and gluttons will come to poverty.) Maybe Nassim Taleb is correct and many successful people are merely lucky and statistical oddities or maybe he is selling a book of excuses.\\n...more\\n\\n']"

I’ve just checked and most of the other reviews of this book do pretty much what I thought they would do. They complain about the tone. This guy is never going to win an award for modesty and he probably thinks you are stupid and have wasted your life. And it gets worse – like that quote from Oscar Wilde that has tormented me for years: “Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do”, this guy reckons that if you work for more than an hour or so per day you are probably too stupid to know (or deserve) any better.Do you hate him yet? I didn’t. I found him very amusing. Admittedly, I probably wouldn’t want to be stuck beside him on a long flight somewhere – but I don’t really go on long flights anywhere, so it doesn’t make too much sense using that as a criterion for anything.Let’s make a proper start. I’m going to tell you something about Heraclitus. Probably best known for some pithy little quotes about change that he made up all by himself a very long time ago. “You can never stand in the same river twice” – “All is flux”. Heraclitus’s vision of the world was that what is important is change, everything else is transitory and impermanent. Bertrand Russell claims that Heraclitus came from an aristocratic family that ended up dashed agains the rocks of change and not nearly so well off. The other thing you might need to know about Heraclitus was that he was known as ‘The Obscure’.I was reminded constantly of Heraclitus while reading this book. The author was also from a well off family that lost everything in the Lebanese War. This also made him focus on change and the nature of unpredictable events. Hardly surprising then that Popper is his favourite philosopher – there is no ultimate truth, rationality is more or less prejudice, everything is awaiting falsification.I have a love/hate relationship with Karl Popper. I can never work out if he is incredibly naïve (as Taleb proudly boasts that he is) or if he is terribly profound. I do like his idea that we should constantly seek to prove our most beloved theories wrong – but I also think that this level of scepticism is somewhat overstated. There is a line in this book in which we are informed (well, twice actually) that Newton was proven wrong by Einstein. Oh, was he just? I guess all those people shot through the head by guns aimed after the careful application of Newton’s laws of motion suddenly came back to life again then did they? I guess Neil Armstrong, who got to the moon on Newtonian physics, not on the front seat of one of Einstein’s light rays, might also have been a bit surprised at this remarkable over-throw.Okay, I know, I’m nitpicking, but then again, Taleb does ask for it. He is so contemptuous of the ignorance and foolishness of others that it does become a bit of a sport for him. The one thing you can say about Taleb is that he is not like Heraclitus when it comes to being obscure. He is always very clear, very comprehensive and very interesting.We should now do some of the people he particularly hates. And in the first rank of those he hates are probably Journalists. Now, it is hard not to agree with him there. He sees Journalism as basically part of the entertainment industry and believes they only really go ‘wrong’ when they start to think they serve some purpose beyond entertainment. Then there are business people, who he believes are mostly thick. One of the main contentions of his book is that successful people are often successful by pure chance. As such their abiding emotion should be gratitude. However, as he repeatedly points out, we all tend to believe our successes are proof of our own genius, and that it is only our failings that are the result of bad luck and chance.This book gives a wonderful introduction to many of the fallacies we humans are all too prone to make. He makes a cogent argument that we can never be ‘purely rational’ because we need our emotions to short-circuit the endless decision loop that each ‘purely rational’ decision would involve. This book is also a great introduction to probability theory without too many numbers – to the theory without the calculus. Some of his verbal explanations of mistakes are remarkably clear – so clear they virtually jump from the page.One of the constant themes that I found particularly interesting was that we all suffer from hindsight bias. This is something I will definitely be taking from this book. The idea is that because what has happened in the past has ‘happened’ we think it is the only thing that could have happened and then use it to predict what will happen in the future. We forget that events in the past were also the culmination of probabilistic situations that have resolved one way and not another. We forget that these events could just as easily have resolved in another equally probable outcome - one that merely did not occur. The range of fallacies that he shows spring from this one bias is quite remarkable.Now, I was recommended this book by someone called Yuri and the funniest story in the book also starred someone called Yuri. It is when he is discussing Stock Market people applying for jobs with him. One of the things they tend to put on their CVs is that they play chess. They do this because playing chess means they are both ‘analytical’ and ‘strategic’. These are obviously good things to be - in fact, I think I would like to be both of these things. Since you can be both of these things just by declaring yourself to be them, we shall take it as read from now on that I am both of these. Taleb tends to prefer to associate with Russian Physicists, not just because they think like him, but also because they can give him lessons in chess and teach him to play piano. When one of these new stock market trader types applies for a job and says that they play chess – Taleb brings this up and then says, “And this is Yuri who will now continue the interview”. And here Yuri appears with a chess board in front of him…I once watched a Russian playing a non-Russian at chess. The Russian spent the entire time laughing his head off after every move. I don't know if it was because the moves made by his opponent were so useless that he truly found them funny or because this was all part of the psychological warfare - but he did slaughter his non-Russian opponent, so perhaps a bit of both.This is another book inspired by behavioural economics (like Freakonomics and Predictably Irrational - I'm becoming a bit of a fan of behavioural economics.If you take this book in good humour, if you allow yourself to listen and not get worked up about his ‘inappropriate tone’ (god save us from those who complain about inappropriate tone) you will learn something from this book and maybe even have a good time.And I can do a two word review of this book - Shit Happens!\\n...more\\n\\n\",\n",

Taleb goes to great lengths to point out how some of the original assumptions made in investments and finance have blown up in people’s faces. Yes, unusual events do happen more often than a normal distribution suggests. Yes, relationships among securities can change in meltdown scenarios. And yes, people are regularly fooled into thinking luck is skill. However, some market participants are clear-sighted enough to see those shrouded risks for what they are and make better assumptions about how they should be traded off against expected returns. These more enlightened investors don’t get the print, though, since they’re not the straw men Taleb can knock down.Don’t get me wrong. We all like debunking stodgy, established wisdom when we see the holes. If you’re like Taleb, though, and see only holes, what you’re left with is nothing. What might there be in its place? Some models, when tweaked, are still useful.In a brief moment of modesty, Taleb confesses to psychological weaknesses that can lead him to mistake noise for signal. He seems rather smug about it all, though. It’s like he figures his ability to recognize himself as a fool puts him on a higher plane. For the most part, his ego is openly displayed. It’s also coupled with an axe to grind – an aggressive combination. His fund has consistently underperformed (though he would counter that he’s positioned just right for the coming holocaust). His investment strategy boils down to buying lots and lots of insurance contracts against rare occurrences that he thinks will be slightly less rare. (In actuality, he buys stock options, but the insurance metaphor illustrates the point.) The problem is he’s so firm in his belief that the insurance companies have underestimated risks that he thinks all premiums are too low. However, those selling options, armed with models that account for rare events appropriately, will charge more than enough to cover those risks.Who will be fortune’s fool? Time will tell, but a provocateur like Taleb will in all probability be better known for his quasi-epistemological exposition on unanticipated variability than for any true investment success.\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

This naturally led me to resent both the time I spent reading it and the author for stretching a good magazine article into book length.What the author has to say is interesting (view spoiler)[ at least at first, after a few repetitions it starts to get a bit stale (hide spoiler)] and it has to be said that skill is required to repeat your ideas repetitively in repetition and to repeatedly stretch repetitively those repeated ideas that would have been enough for a ten or fifteen page article repetitively over three hundred plus pages of repetition. Having said that I did have a warm feeling of Schadenfreude at the plight of the broker who lost everything and was last seen in his string vest smoking a cigarette to death as his few unreprocessed chattels were loaded on to the back of a very small van.The notion of the black swan sums up his argument ie until Europeans arrived in Australia none of them had any idea that there was such a thing as a black swan. In the same way in the markets, or more generally in any activity, you can't calculate the risk or probability of an event if it's never happened - or as in the case of a black swan, if you can't even conceive of the very possibility of the event, the kind of things famously described by Donald Rumsfeld as the 'unknown unknowns'.Reading one gets the impression that Taleb is modestly impressed by his own brilliance, one could well believe that he talks about himself in the third person like Caesar in Asterix, and that he is something of what might be technically described as an arsehole.Borrow don't buy. Even better - borrow the Reader's Digest version.\\n...more\\n\\n\",\n",

He talks about how, for instance, in an upscale neighborhood a janitor who won the lottery may live next to a dentist. Many of us take this information and attribute the likelihood for success as a janitor and a dentist to be closer than it actually is. But being a janitor provides an individual with an opportunity set, with, say a 1% chance of having a high standard of living and a 99% chance of having a low standard living. The dentist opportunity set may be 95% for high standard of living and 5% for low standard of living. But if there are many more janitors than dentists and you live in an upscale neighborhood (where you only see the survivors), that relationship becomes muddled.Anyway, if you believe the preceding ideas, the book doesn\\'t offer much else.\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

I’ve come to realize that some people find Nassim Taleb’s arrogance quite repugnant, but, personally, I find it rather charming. I suspect that the same people who find Taleb’s arrogance off-putting are the people who wish they possessed a shred of his erudition. Nietzsche was certainly on to something; it’s hard to avoid being offended by your betters.I think I first read Fooled By Randomness circa 2006. Recently, I felt a longing to reread Taleb’s first non-technical book again. Wow, what a wise decision that was! I actually digested more from the rereading than I did from the initial reading (and I digested quite a bit from the first reading). Both times, I focused on reading the book very, very slowly. Obviously, the fact that I spent the time to reread this book is indicative of how valuable I think it is.Known for his great wit, the baseball pitcher Vernon Louis “Lefty” Gomez was fond of saying that, “I’d rather be lucky than good.” This phrase, in essence, is one of the central themes of the book. Although it sounds like a hackneyed platitude, Gomez, understood the role of randomness in our lives. However, due to myriad biases, we humans often tend to attribute our successes to our skill and blame bad luck for our failures. Is your rich neighbor or your boss really as skilled as she thinks she is?Parts of the book are also about the hindsight bias and the narrative fallacy. We humans are great at fabricating post hoc narratives about our world. It’s how we understand (and misunderstand) the world, but we must remember not to take our stories too seriously. “A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact,” writes Taleb, “but in the light of the information until that point.”One of Taleb’s favorite philosophers is Karl Popper. However, Taleb wasn’t always enthralled with the man who espoused the beauty of empirical falsification. Prior to rediscovering the great philosopher, Taleb went through a self identified anti-intellectual phase early in his career as a trader. He feared becoming a corporate slave with “work ethics” (a term which he interprets to mean inefficient mediocrity). “Philosophy, to me,” Taleb writes, “became something rhetorical people did when they had plenty of time on their hands; it was an activity reserved for those who were not well versed in quantitative methods and other productive things. It was a pastime that should be limited to late hours, in bars around the campuses, when one had a few drinks and a light schedule — provided one forgot the garrulous episode as early as the next day. Too much of it can get a man in trouble, perhaps turn one into a Marxist ideologue.” As they say, the dose determines the poison.Speaking of poison, another interesting idea that Taleb espouses is that being too attached your beliefs is poisonous. As he puts it: “Loyality to ideas is not a good thing for traders, scientists, — or anyone”. I like to think about it this way, there are times we shouldn’t trust experts precisely because they are experts. This is because they are no incentives to be brutally critical of your own ideas. A scientist or a preacher who has built their career on a certain idea obviously has a lot invested in that idea. How likely are they to be critical of their own position when their livelihood depends on it being accepted? What if they are putting out pseudo-scientific nutritional guidelines that cause harm, but help them keep their job?According to Popper there are only two types of theories:1) Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).2) Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.If you accept Popper’s epistemology, like I also do, you can never claim that you know a theory to be true. In other words, we can only gain knowledge through proving that things are false. For instance, when I accidentally find myself in a theistic debate, people often challenge me to tell them how the universe came into existence. When I say ‘I don’t know’, they become infuriated. How dare I have the gall to dismiss some of their religion’s claims as not true without projecting my own claim to reality? Yet, that’s exactly the point. I gain knowledge through knowing what’s wrong, not through making claims about what I think is right.So what should we make of Taleb’s extreme and obsessive Popperism in a more practical sense? How does he recommend we apply to it our lives? I think it can be summarized in the following passage:I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: No rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me. My idea of science diverges with that of the people around me walking around calling themselves scientists. Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.The following thought experiment really helped me internalize this message. Assume you participate in a gambling game that has 999/1000 chance of winning $1 [Event A] and a 1/1000 chance of winning $10,000 [Event B]. Using some straightforward calculations the expectation of a loss is roughly $9 (multiply the probabilities by the outcome for each event and then sum them) Which event would you bet on? I suspect that most people consider the frequency or probability in their decision, but this is totally irrelevant. According to Taleb, even people like MBAs and economists with some statistical training fail to understand this point. The magnitude of the outcome should be the only relevant factor in the decision. Think of a trader who focuses on event B, sure, he is likely to bleed slowly for long periods of time, but when the rare event happens the payoff is astronomical compared to the losses. Most of us, however, are schooled in environments that focus on games with symmetrical outcomes (e.g., a coin toss). The great psychologist and father of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, also reminds us that we are loss averse and psychologically struggle with idea of bleeding out small losses for extended periods of time, even if there is eventually the opportunity for a huge payday.Once you realize that life is full of scenarios with asymmetrical payoffs, you’re thinking (if you’re anything like me anyway) will be permanently altered. In fields like, say, writing, the outcomes are asymmetrical. In other words, there is not a linear relationship with the number of hours spent writing and the amount of income one makes. One may spend a long time writing for free and then finally catch a huge book deal. For me, this is somewhat of a moot point because I’d write for free without any other justification other than the fact that it’s fun and makes me happy. However, if all other things were equal, and I could also make money doing something I love, I would be very happy.Here’s another piece of practical wisdom that I really enjoyed: “stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a tendency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in the league tables.” These are the same kinds of people who think that their GPA reflects their intelligence. Or that the number of hours they spend running on a treadmill reflects their fitness. Or that their inherited wealth says something about their genetic fitness. Or that their expensive clothes make them beautiful. I could continue on and on, but I think you get the point.I often hear those around me complaining about how life will be better when they achieve “X”. Alas, I’m human and guilty of making claims like this on occasion too. The trouble is that, for most of us anyway, we won’t really experience long-term improvements in our happiness when we achieve “X”. Throughout the book, Taleb devotes a fair amount of time alerting readers of what the literature in behavioral economics tells us about our irrational tendencies and biases.For example, there’s the social treadmill effect: you get rich, move to rich neighborhoods, then become poor again once you compare yourself to your new peers. Then, you may work your ass off and get rich again, only to repeat the cycle. If you want to feel worse about yourself, then the best piece of positive advice I know of is to hang around people who are wealthier than you. I often try to remind myself that I’m living a life that is materially better than 99.9% of all humans that have ever existed and yet I still have the audacity to claim that I don’t have enough sometimes. Pathetic.At one point in the book, Taleb writes: “I see no special heroism in accumulating money, particularly if, in addition, the person is foolish enough to not even try to derive any tangible benefit from wealth (aside from the pleasure of regularly counting the beans)”. In other words, money is only valuable if you use it as a tool to extract enjoyment from life.If it isn’t clear, I think he is making reference to the likes of Warren Buffett, whom people tend to see as being virtuous simply for the fact that he has been able to accumulate hordes of money. What I think many people fail to understand is that there is nothing virtuous about having money just for the sake of having it. How someone earned what they have tells you a lot more about them than how much they have. We generally tend to think that having money signals other traits about a person, but I’ll remind you that there is a lot of noise in those signals (think inheritance). Having money doesn’t necessarily signal any superior traits.Those who want to make a lot of money are greedy and shouldn’t try to deny that motivation. Greed, however, is not necessarily a bad thing. As Adam Smith taught us, another mans’ greed can create more wealth for society as a whole (provided the individual’s wealth is ethically obtained).Do cigarette smokers understand probabilities? If so, how can they rationally understand the ills of cigarettes and yet be foolish enough to smoke them anyway? When I go for walks near hospitals I’m always surprised by the number of people in scrubs (perhaps some of whom are doctors and nurses) who I assume are well aware of how harmful cigarettes are, but smoke them anyway. Apparently, intellectually understanding something and being able to put it into practice are two different things.One thing Taleb also writes about is the selection bias in blogging and book reviewing. The cover of my edition of Fooled By Randomness has an excerpt praising Taleb as one of the “hottest thinkers” in the world. While I certainly agree, I couldn’t help but smirk after reading that line — can you say selection bias?Any book that is worth reading twice is worth reading more than twice.

Part II would have been pretty good if I hadn't read a lot of other books on the topics, and for those who are interested in economic markets, I think this would interest you if you can move past the constant interjections of Taleb's personal philosophy. Personally, my eyes glaze over when I read about trading, and I much prefer books like The Drunkard's Walk, which illustrates many of the same (but also many more) concepts. I was happy to read the section on Tversky and Kahneman, but I find their work infinitely more interesting and readable than his summary, and you are spared the normative commentary. Ironic for a man who criticises the normative dimensions of economics, Taleb certainly pushes a strong view of the world. When Taleb does delve into intriguing concepts, I was frustrated with the fact that he explained them poorly and incompletely, and quickly moved on to another topic. Much of the anecdote in the book could have been removed to make way for the real substance of the book. I don't really disagree with his criticisms of MBAs, economists, traders, journalists, etc., but I also don't think anything he says is especially revealing of insightful for most of us who aren't involved in the trading world. All in all, I am really puzzled by the popularity of this book, and I would strongly recommend against bothering with this one.

Cliches exist for a reason, but 196 pages later I feel the point has been well made.Taleb is a stock market trader. As a trader, he believes that there is no way in general to predict the stock market -- that there are so many variables that the resulting stock price is indistinguishable from pure noise. Unfortunately, his profession is filled with people who believe that they *can* predict the market. In fact, some of these people trade very successfully for a while. Taleb belives that no trader can stay ahead of the market forever. The success of a small number of traders for a short amount of time can simply be explained by statistics: after all, given a large enough group of traders, some are bound to be successful some of the time even if their trades are entirely random.This point is well illustrated with many examples, and this is where the book falters for me. Some of the examples are great (he goes into a lot of detail about various Monte Carlo simulations he has constructed), but some just seem like strawmen (he goes to a lot of trouble to describe the fancy cars, extravagant house, impulsive trading strategy, and hubris of a hypothetical trader, setting him up for his inevitable fall at the hands of the \"unexpected rare event\").Some examples are just plain wrong, or at least misleading. For example, he goes into detail describing the work of Karl Popper, a philosopher who was interested in the question \"how do you tell the difference between science and non-science?\" Popper proposed several theories of science to answer this question.The first, naive falsificationism, essentially states two things: firstly, that a theory is scientific if it can be falsified; and secondly, that a theory which has been falsified should no longer be used.The second, sophisticated falsificationism, was a response to both the negativity of naive falsificationism and also a response to the criticism that science doesn\\'t work that way (by immediately discarding theories the moment they contradict any evidence). Sophisticated falsificationism again states two things: that a theory is scientific if it leads to the discovery of novel (ie, new) facts; and that a theory is falsified by a new theory if the new theory can accurately predict everything the old theory could but *also* can accurately predict novel facts. General relativity is the canonical example of this: it incorporates Newtonian mechanics at low speeds but also explains things that Newtonian mechanics cannot at near-light speeds.Anyway, Taleb\\'s summary of all of this was \"Popper\\'s detractors called him a naive falsificationist.\" They did not, or at least not disparagingly, because Popper himself proposed the term, and labeled himself accordingly! I can understand why Taleb might not have wanted to include a huge explicative paragraph on Popper, but the book would have been just fine without the dubious example.Another example of sloppiness occurs later, when Taleb talks about the QWERTY keyboard layout as an example of \"the vicious dynamics of winning and losing in an economy\" and repeats the old saw that the QWERTY layout was designed to slow typists down, and that it succeeded anyway because of a \"snowball effect\" of popularity. This claim is highly contentious (in fact one way to both speed typists up and prevent mechanical key jams is to put commonly-used letter combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard, something that QWERTY does to some extent but that Dvorak does much better), and once again the book would have been just fine without it.Taleb is best when he is covering his area of expertise -- probability -- and the chapters dealing with probability are great. There are also several enjoyable and illustrative personal anecdotes which are a fun and memorable read.Overall I enjoyed the book.

Nassim Taleb\\'s book is highly idiosyncratic and personal, which is both what lends it a lot of its interest and what occasionally makes it irritating. Overall, he does not seem like a likeable man, and in fact is probably proud of that fact. But, it does get kind of tiresome to be told for the 5th or 10th time how unimpressed by wealth he is. In fact, he is clearly impressed by wealth, but counteracts it by stressing how little he works, how much time he devotes to intellectual pursuits and how much smarter he is than the typical wealthy person. But, all that’s just literary style -- and apparently a very popular one, judging by the sales of the book. It remains a fascinating book nonetheless.Key ideas: We do not gauge causation, probability and risk very well, and hence we do not act according to a rational model of behavior, a la homo economicus. His heroes are Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky, whom Taleb sees as the greatest thinkers in modern economics, since they re-wrote the book about how we actually decide as opposed to how economists and other rationalists think we ought to decide. Based on their work and that of a host of other researchers in behavioral economics/finance, he catalogs many of the systematic biases that strongly affect our behavior, such as:o\\tHindsight bias: We fit the explanation to the events after the fact, as if we knew it at the time. And, we see patterns where there are none – or we see the wrong pattern. Mistrust the predictions of experts – they will almost always be trumped by an evidence-based analysis, since they tend to mis-remember the past. They remember their successes and forget their failures. o\\tAttribution bias: Beautiful people are more virtuous than ugly people. Tall people are more likely to be leaders than short people. A man in a suit is more trustworthy than a man in t-shirt and jeans. And so on. o\\tSmall number bias: We extrapolate wildly from small samples.o\\tAsymmetric pain/pleasure from losses or gains: The pain of a loss is roughly twice as much as the pleasure from an equivalent-sized gain. So we sell our winners but keep our losers (to avoid having to feel the pain).In short, life is more random than you think and your ability to navigate it rationally is more limited than you think. What do I think of all this? He\\'s right that it\\'s a good idea to keep an open mind and to be ready to change your mind when you come up with a better interpretation and/or a more accurate set of facts. So far, so good. But his core world view is the product of the only profession he\\'s ever known: Wall Street trading. As such, he does not shape let alone control events -- he simply bets on their outcome. That\\'s not the kind of perspective that makes you see the world as a highly deterministic place, or one where, if you hope to survive long enough to get a few gray hairs, you can think of yourself as a \"master of the universe\" or even captain of your ship. He doesn\\'t want to be captain of the ship; he just wants to bet on whether the ship will sink in the next storm or not, and turn a profit on the bet.\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

At times the logic and flow is so jumpy and flawed that I thought there was something wrong with my copy.There is something wrong almost constantly, but the biggest WTF moment came for me, when Taleb, who constantly reminds the reader that everybody else is a fool and it\\'s just him who has insight and the tools to master probability, talks about scientific study of medication and the absence-of-evidence-cliché. It makes him furious that so many of the idiot journalists out there misunderstand absence of evidence for evidence of absence, and he cites studies where despite numerous subjects no significant benefit can be shown for a medication over placebo treatment. This is not evidence that there is no effect of the medication! he yells, and completely fails to understand the difference between significance and effect size. Yes, it may well come out later that the medication indeed does have an effect. But no, it is not at all likely that that effect will be very relevant, as its size must be tiny or the original study methodically flawed (as otherwise it would have found it).To reiterate, Taleb does not distinguish between significance and effect size in an argument where he calls everyone else a fool for not getting probabilities right. Sums up the book quite nicely.(In addition, it is very annoying when his constant reminding the reader that he is no expert on something does not stop him from talking about it, just from giving any evidence for what he is talking about whatsoever. This is mainly true for evolutionary psychology, but threads throughout. \"I\\'m not a scientist, but a humble trader, so I\\'ll just make shit up now\" does not really work as captatio benevolentiae).\\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

I'll leave you with James Clear's excellent three sentence summary:Randomness, chance, and luck influence our lives and our work more than we realize. Because of hindsight bias and survivorship bias, in particular, we tend to forget the many who fail, remember the few who succeed, and then create reasons and patterns for their success even though it was largely random. Mild success can be explainable by skills and hard work, but wild success is usually attributable to variance and luck.\\n...more\\n\\n\",\n",

Desperate, he travels to Lourdes to pray and drink miraculous water. He heals. He says he was healed by the blessed Virgin Mary. A poor, plain-looking dude like Jack Ma toiled and moiled to make a name for himself and get out of the rut he was in. He succeeded and became one of the richest men in the world. He now tours all over delivering lectures on how to achieve success, preaching its secrets he claim to have discovered. A priest is buried then exhumed several years later and his body had not decomposed. He is sainted. An idiot, with his unique brand of idiocy, captures the imagination of his fellow citizens who are mostly idiots like him anyway. So he wins the elections and, perplexed by his victory, credits the hand of God for it. So he starts to implement his idiotic ideas, reasoning out that since God himself put him into office, then God must have approved of his plans, no matter how unquestionably evil they are.There are many such examples. What is hidden, and which causes the deception, are facts like: MILLIONS as sick as the young man, who drank more holy water than him and prayed even more and visited more holy sites were not healed and had died on schedule; MILLIONS who did what Jack Ma had done and followed what he reveals now as secrets to success, achieved no such success and remained poor or middle class; evil leaders had won elections fair and square, slaughtered millions and caused a lot of sufferings which one can hardly attribute to divine providence; terminally ill agnostics and atheists occasionally enjoying spontaneous healing without praying, drinking miraculous water or going into religious pilgrimages. Fairly recently, a wonderfully preserved body of a long deceased soft porn actress was dug up and no one called her an “incorruptible” like the heart of Padre Pio because she was not known to have lived a holy life when she was still alive.This is, more or less, the main thesis of this book. It unashamedly is—“about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). It manifests itself in the shape of the LUCKY FOOL, defined as a person who benefited from a disproportionately share of luck but attributes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason. Such confusion crops up in the most unexpected areas, even science, though not in such an accentuated and obvious manner as it does in the world of business. It is endemic in politics, as it can be encountered in the shahpe of a country’s president discoursing on the jobs that HE created, HIS recovery, and “his predecessor’s” inflation.”I like books like this which make you think and question generally-held beliefs. \\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

It has everything in a book that I yearn for....interesting ideas...some of which I don\\'t grasp because hey are too clever for me...a smug narrator who seemingly knows more than everyone else...and a well-written and pleasing style.Here is the crux of the book. Brokers have a very common weakness. They fail to appreciate that the likelihood of an event can not be the only factor one looks at when deciding to make a move. The likelihood, and the cost of the mistake are both critical.For example. If I told you that you could make $ 100 on every trade for 99/100 times, would you do it? The correct answer, depends on what happens on the other chance. When you are in a market, or some other experience where there are lots of repeated throws of the dice, the rare odd will happen, which is often when you hear of a trader \\'blowing up\\'. When that happens, the greater and powerful \"Master-of-the-Universe\" disappears, and is banished forever...deemed a failure by his peers. What happened, is that he was unaware of the \\'Black Swan\\', the title of another book by the same author.In Europe in the middle ages, because all swans that had been seen were white, it had been postulated that ALL swans were white...a fallacy ultimately disproven when the contrary evidence was eventually found in Australia. In basic logical terms, the absence of B within a data set not proven to be the entire sum does not equal \\'always A\\'.So this \\'Black Swan\\', the one throw out of 100 can and does happen. In the previous example, if you won all the previous 99 throws, you would have earned $9900. That sounds great, until you learn that loosing the final throw costs you $200,000. Knowing those odds, would you play the game? This basic fallacy, the lack of assessing the intensity of the randomness, is what dooms many people who sound well and truly brilliant...right until they blow up and are never heard from again. Of course, there are other brilliant comments on the need to ignore useless and irrelevant noise, and train ourself to recognize that a random fluctuation is just that, and one should not search for a reason for mere statistical chatter, but the analogy of the black swan is the main crux of this wonderfully well-written book. \\n...more\\n\\n',\n",

The author’s most famous exclamation is that the 40 years of investment success experienced by Warren Buffett, \"may be by chance.\" He claims that with the number of investors, it was a statistical certainty that one would obtain Buffett’s success.Obviously, life is full of random events. And some people benefit from occasional windfalls or bonanzas, while others experience tragic accidents. Furthermore, the line between success and failure is often very thin. However, most observant people are able to notice traits that are common to typical people: whether it is successful investors or professional basketball players. Investors may have strong math skills and confidence while professional basketball players may possess incredible athletic ability and be exceptionally tall. People who experience sustained success usually have certain traits (as King Solomon noted over 3,000 years ago. He observed the plans of the diligent led, surely to success, while drunkard and gluttons will come to poverty.) Maybe Nassim Taleb is correct and many successful people are merely lucky and statistical oddities or maybe he is selling a book of excuses.\\n...more\\n\\n']"

I would rather have every one of my biases and heuristics kicked around so I will reconsider where they came from--and whether to keep them--than be coddled and comforted.Perhaps the best heuristic reminders I received from this book: 1/ Invest (trust) in people, not plans. 2/ Favor broad diversification so as to reduce negative exposure to any given event. 3/ Look for optionality; rank things according to optionality, preferably with open-ended payoffs. 4/ Options that benefit from volatility, disruption, and entropy are the best--but keep your \"skin in the game;\" never transfer your fragility to someone else. 5/ Eschew intervention unless it is completely obvious that lack of intervention in a given critical case is much more dangerous. 6/ If you generate more than one* reason to do something, you\\'re trying to convince yourself; this is a strong sign to wait or even reject the plan; that said, if you have a single excellent reason, go for it and don\\'t be afraid of failure. 7/ You learn more from failure (\"subtractive knowledge\") than success anyway.(* My personal threshold is three reasons.)Favorite quote from this book: \"The worst problem of modernity lies in the malignant transfer of fragility and antifragility from one party to the other, with one getting the benefits, the other (unwittingly) getting the harm, with such transfer facilitated by the growing wedge between the ethical and the legal.\"My own aphorisms inspired by this book: 1/ To add is folly; to abstain, wise; subtract, divine. 2/ All models have at least one too many degrees of freedom, and all models have at least one wrong premise.

The word \"adaptable\" wouldn\\'t suffice? \"Antifragile\" is not the last word he makes up, either. Instead of writing the word \"brave,\" for instance, he substitutes \"nonmeek.\" In the future, I would suggest the author try using a thesaurus, or as he probably calls it, an \"antidictionary.\"Elsewhere, the author launches into lengthy diatribes against academia, which he \"tried\" but found university life filled with \"petty obsessions, envy, and icy-cold hatreds.\" He says that business, in contrast, \"brings out the best in people...[and makes people] forgiving, honest, loving, and trusting.\" It was at this point, on page 17, that I contemplated throwing the book against the wall (for the first, but not last time). I ultimately never threw it, because at nearly 500 pages, I was worried about damaging my apartment\\'s drywall.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\n\"Antifragile\" is a book that is difficult to summarize.

In that way, it as rich on page 400 as it is on page 2.Taleb is an independent thinker who is almost impossible to categorize. In fact he revels in question some of the most basic assumptions of modern life. There are times I find him pompous and nearly conceited, and times when you realize that in going after the people and ideas that he does that he needs a very thick skin a quite a bit of confidence. He backs up views with layers of research and technical material. When I find him at his best though, is when he takes an idea that you\\'ve taken for granted and finds a dozen ways to show you why it\\'s farcical.If you\\'ve ever seen him on television or on video, do not take that persona as the one in this book. Although he defends his style, I\\'ve found his public appearances on the whole pretty awful. I saw him on Fareed Zakaria\\'s show the other day, and even though I was 3/4 through his book, I could still barely understand his points. Taleb though, would say that\\'s by design - that by having to work for understanding, his viewers are forced to stay for cognitively engaged - I don\\'t buy it. He is a much better author than he is a speaker, and he probably likes it that way.\"Antifragile\" is about fragility and it\\'s converse, antifragility. In fragile systems the benefits are small and visible, and the the side effects are potentially severe and invisible.Taleb illustrates the basics of fragile/antifragile with the example of package to be shipped. If you were to pack glasses in the box, even carefully, you would still know that the box would not respond well to disturbances like being dropped or mishandled. Glasses are fragile. If you were to pack a steel cube in the box, you would have no such problem. Drop it or whatever, the cube is \"robust\", not changed by disturbances. However, imagine if there was an item you put in the box that was improved by disturbances, that was made stronger or more capable by being mishandled. That is the true opposite of fragile, or as Taleb refers to this property - antifragile.What are real life examples of antifragility? Evolution for one, functions better when being put under stress. Entrepreneurial ventures too, are made better by an uncertain environment, because they are organizations designed to learn and change from stresses. Sometimes, a system is antifragile, even though it\\'s components aren\\'t; organisms might die because of stress, but the entire ecosystem is made stronger over the long run.A key point he makes is that in our rush to help, fix, or support system - in short, *do something*, we often make systems more fragile in the long run. One of his primary examples is medicine. In our efforts to make relatively small improvements to peoples lives through intervention, our health in the long run becomes more fragile, subject to the long term effects of drugs and therapies, and by the lifestyles that continue to enable.His point is that you bet on the most tested system, and the most tested system we know of is Mother Nature and evolution. Anything we do needs to be judged against systems that had millions of years of stresses. This is not to say that modern medicine is a bad thing, because when it is helpful, it is *very* helpful, but when it it used for relatively minor improvements, the risks outweigh the rewards.Because of this, he is a strong advocate of intervention by subtraction. Instead of finding better cures for diabetes, modify diets to remove sugary foods. Indeed, stopping smoking has been one of the most successful medical interventions of the last 40 years. He introduced me to the term iatrogrenic - making things worse by doing something.The essence of the Black Swan - the event that is so rare that it\\'s never been observed (or maybe maybe never occurred) before, is the fallacy that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. These are not the same thing. However, we often treat them as synonymous, until something totally unforseen happens. And that\\'s part of the point. Unforseen events are not failures of prediction - they are simply unforseeable. We need to ready our systems that we cannot anticipate - that is, built systems that are at least robust, and that are hopefully antifragile.Finally, he feels that the major cause of fragility in modern life is lack of \"skin in the game\" when one set of people become antifragile and transfer the fragility to another set of people. Some examples include managers of large corporations who do well no matter how their company does or the effect it has on the general economy. Writers and pundits who push views but have are in no way affected no matter if they are right or wrong. Politicians who enact complex policies but who are in no way affected by them, and who in fact use this complexity to become highly compensated once they leave office. This last point should especially be taken to heart. Keep an eye out for who is saying and doing things, and how much stake they personally have in whether they are correct. If the answer is zero, or even worse, they are betting against themselves, then they are not to be taken seriously.Overall, this was a book that made me re-evaluate who sets of assumptions I\\'ve made about how the world works, which for me is the ultimate test of any book of this type. It\\'s not an easy read, and there is material in there to challenge almost any reader (philosophy, mathematics, business, economics to name a few), but it is well worth the trip.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nTaleb has some great ideas.

Which, for Taleb, includes pretty much anyone, including editors, whose help he could use.When are two similar ideas not really the same? Taleb takes the human immune response and the muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training as examples of the same thing--systems responding to stress by getting better able to handle the stress. And they do have that in common. But they are different--and very specialized--systemic responses. What do they have in common? What can we learn from them, apart from the fact that solving problems is good?Taleb later argues that avoiding stress is bad--that it prevents the organism from developing the ability to manage the stress that will eventually return in a stronger form. But it\\'s not clear how the good system designed to deal with stress differ from the bad ones. If exposure to small stresses is good because it allows you to overcome the stress, why is overcoming the stress bad? The famously complex immune system, with its unfortunate side effects (allergies, auto-immune disease) looks a lot like the sort of overengineered over-protective solution with unintended consequences Taleb later mocks.Moving on from the organism, Taleb\\'s next example is evolution. He does acknowledge that the organism and the species have very different views on what is good. The species is antifragile, and it thrives, often, when particular organisms do not. Selection pressures kill individuals, but they strengthen the group, argues Taleb. But selection pressures also wipe out species. And genera. And orders. And so on. And they\\'ll wipe out all of life, possibly. Meanwhile, they do create conditions that result in the magic of evolution, but the awards go to the survivors, those most successful at avoiding or handling stress, not those who subject themselves to the most stress. There is no \"Nature\" that \"likes\" stress (one of Taleb\\'s more troublesome figures of speech). I don\\'t have time to pick apart every example and argument he makes, nor would it be possible, as each one reappears several times in a vague skein of association that prevents the clear development of any single idea. Here is where we most feel the absence of the editor. Didn\\'t he already say that? Didn\\'t he define that term before? No? Could this book be boiled down by about 70%?I do have to mention the use of math. He often suggests that the reader skip a section (would that I had) as it is more \"technical.\" But there was no difference that I could see between the \"technical\" and \"non-technical\" parts: both were vague and repetitive. There\\'s even a \"technical\" appendix, which I turned to quite avidly, hoping for more concrete development of Taleb\\'s ideas. But no. All I found was a brilliant exhibit of how to detect math BS: if an author provides an equation that includes variables that are not defined anywhere in the text, then the equation is meaningless and the author is blowing smoke. In the economic world, Taleb is a bit more persuasive. The law of unintended consequences is well-known, and it\\'s no surprise that efforts to protect this market or that industry are usually lobbyist-hatched schemes to assist those least in need of assistance. Where firms are able to succeed in spite of challenges, they have often grown strong enough to challenge firms grown in the hothouse environment of closed markets. If Taleb had written about this, it might have been as good a book as The Black Swan. But, with his FU money and his goal of becoming a philosopher, he must have decided that was too pedestrian.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nThis book has been such a disappointment...It started absolutely great and has an idea (antifragility) that is worthy and notable and interesting.

Wait, let me back up from the beginning: I could not finish this book.When I read non fiction I tend to stick to certain rules:1) I want to learn from the books I read. I tend not to read Mathematics, for example, except in formal context, since normally when I read Math being exposed to the general public I noticed how poorly they are really explaining the concepts.2) I don\\'t read books if I agree with the conclusion. For example, since I am an atheist, I seldom read books on the subject of why we should be atheists, I enjoy the rest of Richard Dawkins works.3) I refused to be bored. Despite the previous points I do not read books on astrology, for example, because I am certain they will not convince me of their truth (I won\\'t learn from them), but even more certain I will find them utterly and completely boring.This book started as an amazing jewel. A book where I was reaching for the, thankfully virtual, dictionary almost in every page. When I read the page, almost at the beginning of the book, that said:\"Now we aim--after some work--to connect in the reader\\'s mind, with a single thread, elements seemingly far apart, such as Cato the Elder, Nietzsche, Thales of Miletus, the potency of the system of city-states, the sustainability of artisans, the process of discovery, the onesidedness of opacity, financial derivatives, antibiotic resistance, bottom-up systems, Socrates\\' invitation to overrationalize, how to lecture birds, obsessive love, Darwinian evolution, the mathematical concept of Jensen\\'s inequality, optionality and option theory, the idea of ancestral heuristics, the works of Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke, Wittgenstein\\'s antirationalism, the fraudulent theories of the economics establishment, tinkering and bricolage, terrorism exacerbated by death of its members, an apologia for artisanal societies, the ethical flaws of the middle class, Paleo-style workouts (and nutrition), the idea of medical iatrogenics, the glorious notion of the magnificent (megalopsychon), my obsession with the idea of convexity (and my phobia of concavity), the late-2000s banking and economic crisis, the misunderstanding of redundancy, the difference between tourist and flâneur, etc. All in one single--and, I am certain, simple--thread.\"I thought I was in for the biggest treat in reading since Wittgenstein.Alas, though the book starts in a wonderful way and the idea of antifragility is an amazing idea, at some point you realize something is happening. At first, the author criticizes pseudo scientificism, then stars swearing for Baal. That is followed by an exposition of the trivial truth that there are options outside finance that are poorly priced, as if that was a hidden, previously unknown idea. And finally, around the middle of the book, he dismisses science all together. He claims, and, unfortunately, fails to prove, that science does not produce most of the technological (and others? Not clear) innovations through history. He does this through the simple method of claiming we got it backwards, then claiming that in some cases some people claim we got it backwards, then admitting that there may be a few cases where we got it right, but that those are not important. All this starts with some academicians giving birds lectures on how to fly... Before you continue reading this review, may I remind you again that I could not finish this book? It became boring. Furthermore, if you agree with the author, I should point out that I am, of course, a sworn enemy of what he exposes, having a PhD in mathematics and all. Never lectured birds though, just taught some calculus and functional analysis to non flying human beings.Case in point. He claims Euclid results aren\\'t used in Architecture. Then admits that the Pythagorean Theorem is used somewhat in architecture. Who has claim Euclid was central to architecture is not clear... But this represents an ignorance of what Euclid did. He was formalizing previous knowledge. This knowledge was not all original, though some was. To say that people knew some of the things Euclid did before he wrote his books, through trial and error is trivial. Before Pythagoras, the Chinese and the Babylonians knew examples of Pythagorean Triangles, the Chinese may even have known the theorem. What we appreciate from Pythagoras is the proof, which Euclid wrote, not claiming it was being written for the first time. To claim that the pythagorean theorem or trigonometry wasn\\'t used in architecture or engineering before the renaissance is just mere blindness. Go ahead, attempt to build a tunnel or measure a distance or calculating how many stones you need for that door, without anything in the books of Euclid. I\\'ll wait. Yes, people didn\\'t cite or knew Euclid, but they were using the results, not referencing scientific literature.To say that academic research is not based on trial and error is not just a mistake. but not having and inkling of what is involved in any type of academic research, at least in the hard sciences. Academic research, even in mathematics, consist of nothing but trial and error! Yes, afterwards we write the papers as if we knew everything all along, but that is not the practice of science, but its result.To then say that academic research has not contributed to innovations in technology and to try to claim that \"drop outs\\' have innovated more is confusing the business of technology with technology itself, is ignoring what cryptography is, and how it developed, is ignoring the irony of the applicability of Hardy\\'s mathematical results, is ignoring the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, NASA, HP, and a million others. It\\'s, simply, claiming as true what you wanted to be true, without examining it honestly. To use the internet as an example of academic research not contributing in technology is to deny a reality that I lived.At the end, this book is dishonest and boring. Yes, it may have something to be learned from it, but it is an injustice to try to pass crummy thinking as if it was part of a great idea.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat a frustrating book.10% of it was brilliant and original ideas - I was very glad to learn about antifragility and optionality as it relates to life and business.Unfortunately, the other 90% of it was spent whining (I can\\'t describe it any other way) and moralizing, of the most weaksauce variety.

That\\'s reading, right?Or is it?I started off pretty well, somehow managing to get my brain around the whole idea of antifragile, a word the author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, admits he made up. There is no real word in English that properly names this idea. Everyone understands the idea of fragile, something that is destroyed when stressed. But the opposite of fragile is more than just something that survives difficulties. Antifragility, Taleb tells us, is the idea of a phenomenon that goes beyond mere resilience; antifragility is the idea of something that actually improves with difficulties and uncertainty.Taleb gives us lots of great examples of things that are antifragile: \"...evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance...even our own existence as a species on this planet.\"I\\'m high-five-ing him, right and left...love this idea of antifragile, Taleb.That was the Prologue, however. Round about the second or third page of Chapter 1, I find that I\\'m reading along, with no idea what Mr. Taleb is explaining. He tries, he really does, and now and then I read a paragraph and think I\\'m back on the highway. The Soviet-Harvard Department of Ornithology, for example. (How well do I know that department, the people who lecture to birds about proper techniques for flying, observe and write reports about the birds\\' flying abilities, and then seek funding to ensure that the lectures will continue!) But, soon I\\'m back driving in the dark again.I don\\'t know if I really read this book. Can I add it to my 2013 Book Log? Does it count? Please don\\'t ask me to summarize it or outline it or (heaven forbid!) don\\'t test me on it.But if I didn\\'t really read it, why did I like it so much? And why can\\'t I stop thinking about it?Maybe what I did when I read Antifragile was antireading. Maybe antireading is the kind of reading where you turn the pages and read the words, but understand only a smidgen of what\\'s there, and then you think about it for weeks, and come back to the book again and again, and maybe try to reread it, and it tweaks your map about this life, even through you really didn\\'t understand much of what you read to begin with.Maybe antireading is the best kind of reading of all.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nThe author somehow is able to pull off sounding like an arrogant prick and simultaneously like an insecure whiner.

Taleb has a very non-traditional style of writing--often conversational, historical, philosophical, and scientific--all at the same time. Taleb\\'s basic thesis is that people and institutions are either fragile, robust, or antifragile. A fragile person is one who thinks he can predict the future--and when things go very sour, he is sorely hurt, usually in a financial way. A robust person is one who has set himself up so that he is neutral to downturn episodes. An antifragile person knows that he cannot predict the future, especially outliers and catastrophic downturns. So, he has situated himself so that in normal times he may lose a little, but when a downturn occurs, he stands to gain--a lot.Taleb writes,In short, the fragilista (medical, economic, social planning) is one who makes you engage in policies and actions, all artificial, in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible.He writes a lot about the policy fragilista \"... who mistakes the economy for a washing machine that continuously needs fixing (by him) and blows it up ...\" and \"... financial fragilista who makes people use risk models that destroy the banking system (then uses them again.\" And the fragile financial people will claim that all is right with the world. Then, after a financial disaster they will try to rewrite history, claiming that they predicted the disaster, and tried to avert it.Taleb is very outspoken in his opinions. When he published The Black Swan he was the recipient of many attacks. With this book, he should be the recipient of many more, stronger attacks. He is definitely against academics who do not have any \"skin in the game\", and comes out heavily in favor of small businesses; he believes that \"...small commerce is door to tolerance\".Taleb is extremely critical of fragile institutions. He considers the Office of Management and Budget to be a bunch of scam artists, who are arrogant to believe they can predict the future.Taleb is against much of the scientific basic research as practiced by academics. He uses a metaphor of academics using arcane jargon and mathematics, lecturing birds on how to fly. Then the birds actually fly, so the academics take credit for successfully teaching them, and get government grants. Of course the metaphor sounds silly, but replace \"birds\" with \"men\", and you get the picture. Taleb mentions the Yiddish saying, \"If the student is smart, the teacher takes the credit.\" Furthermore, Taleb criticizes academics who use statistics to prove a hypothesis. He accuses them of \"cherry picking\" with statistics. Sciences that do not use statistics for proofs (like physics) are not so prone to this approach.It is obvious, too, that Taleb had a lot of fun writing this book. For example, he proposed a rather simple financial concept that the experts considered to be too trivial to be true. So he writes, According to the wonderful principle that one should use people\\'s stupidity to have fun, I invited my friend Raphael Douady to collaborate in expressing this simple idea using the most opaque mathematical derivations, with incomprehensible theorems that would take half a day (for a professional) to understand. Then the experts started to agree with him!Taleb is a moralist, and has lots of ethical lessons to give. For example, he writes that one of the purposes of religion is to protect us from scientism. He hates futurists like Ray Kurzweill, who he calls the \"anti-me\". He also detests people who greedily use invisible \"optionality\" to get ahead at the expense of others. I won\\'t explain optionality here, other than to say that it is the use of asymmetry that only has an upside (for oneself) and no downside (except perhaps for others). He also hates journalists who help to instigate violence and wars, with no negative consequences when the outcomes are horrific.The two appendices are quite unique for a book like this. The first appendix uses graphs to portray all of the interesting concepts that he introduced throughout the book. The second appendix uses some rather technical mathematics to illustrate his ideas. At a few places in the book, especially with the philosophical topics, the writing becomes a bit tedious and sometimes strays off-topic. But overall, this is a marvelous book that is both entertaining and profound.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nI sat on this review for a long time, because this book bothered me.

Further, he is on Al-Ghazali\\'s side, a Spanish Muslim who is the chief evil responsible for Islam falling from its tolerant golden age into its present dark age. Big time warning bells!!!No serious proof or consideration of counterexamples enters into a discussion of the superiority of city-states over today\\'s political arrangements. Taleb argues that war is more prevalent today for a couple of pages and considers the argument won (something Steven Pinker argues against for 832 pages in Better Angels of our Nature). He says that there were no dental cavities in the past; Jared Diamond says that primitive man often died because of dental issues. Taleb calls the Code of Hammurabi \"more advanced\" (381). Really? A code of laws that calls for the innocent son of a builder to be killed for the builder\\'s shortcomings is more advanced?He argues that, in the medical world, the \"iatrogenics of the last century\" is a detriment, acting as if is he unaware of the vast improvements in real-world medical results (vaccines, pregnancy-related care, life expectancy...). The quacks that Taleb loves so well have accomplished none of this.When Taleb thinks he is making an argument he is usually making a weak excuse instead of a legitimate point. Often his arguments take the form of insults (he often calls his opponents \"nerds\", he uses \"businessmen\" is a bad word, he uses negative physical characteristics to describe opponents - he likes to suggest that they are fat slobs).I would not recommend this to anyone.

If I had to pick the 2 big ideas of the book I would say they are: 1. Design your life around anti-fragility (allow the stress of life to strengthen you) rather than breaking (being fragile) or being robust (denying change, not improving). Example: If you pick a glass jar off the floor and drop it, it will break if you drop from enough height, it\\'s fragile. If you pick up a rubber ball off the floor and drop it, it will bounce instead of breaking, it\\'s robust and will be unchanged.

So only a small difference can have a large impact on the outcome. Avoid situations with limited upside and very large non-linear downside which are as the author says \"sucker’s bets\" and instead seek situations which have limited downside and very large non-linear upside.One thing about this book is that it\\'s not easy to digest, it took me longer than usual to read it because of the complexity of ideas presented inside and my suggestion is don\\'t rush it.

It is just not worth wasting the time. The author has such a pompous view of himself that the first quarter of the book left me positively nauseated. I tried to put personal feelings aside, giving the benefit of the doubt (perhaps he was \"challenging\" my old mindsets), and focusing on the ideas. I read on because of so many positive reviews. For a while the book did get better. There was less of the author talking about himself as brilliant and misunderstood (or resented) and more about his actual ideas. There were some good ideas, though I found little that has not been put forth before, using other terms of definition. Perhaps some of these concepts aren\\'t common knowledge, but neither is it the first time anybody had an insight on these points. He liked keeping most systems simple and unregulated. No big business or big government. He usually railed on government regulations, though he believed in \"staunch intervention in some areas, such as ecology or to limit the economic distortions and moral hazards caused by large corporations.\" Since no one can even out the ups and downs of life, his advice to individuals was a \"dumbbell approach\" of balancing stability with risks, rather than trying for safety in the middle. Anticipate the worst and build in redundant or independent systems,quit relying on past history and \"tweaking\" the established system if you want true safety in a changing and unpredictable world. No problem with many of his points, but they are not radically new.I find it annoying that the author makes up his own words to identify concepts already adequately defined elsewhere.Reading this book was like being stuck on vacation with a know-it-all conspiracy theorist who never lets up.

Still, I would prefer to slog through a bulleted list of factoids than to read them in his \"I\\'m grinding an axe\" framework.

They’re incomprehensible of course, and I don’t read them. But I did read Antifragile. All of it, including the appendix.Oh, god, where to begin? This is one big ol’ mess of a book. It would be mildly entertaining as an autobiography, and bears a resemblance to Monty Python in places, but it isn’t supposed to be either of those. Reading between the lines (rather easy because he is disarmingly frank about his emotions and reactions) Mr Taleb was clearly outraged and humiliated by a rejection from a prestigious Ivy-League university, (probably Harvard), as the book drips with contempt for academics in general, and the economic fraternity in particular. With good reason perhaps – economics is not called The Dismal Science for nothing. Despite that, he is now an international celebrity. But I don’t know why -this is the most demented, scatter-brained mixture of blindingly-obvious platitudes, mis-applied analogies, extended references to the Greek and Roman Classics, and homespun truths that I have ever waded through. Yes, I read the whole thing because I still believe there are some grains of truth here. In fact, I have a lot of sympathy with many of his views – the financial sector (where previously he worked as a derivatives trader) IS a self-serving, bombastic, bloated time bomb of greed. That seems to have been a shock to the young Taleb. He was a naive graduate in the mathematical theory of Derivatives trading (I think) when he first discovered that colossal fortunes were being made by the pit traders who knew nothing about theory or even the products they were trading. (His friend Fat Tony, who appears throughout the book, was one of those traders). From this initial shock he formulated the idea that the theories themselves were crap, but there must be something systematic you could extract from the underlying variances (ie, uncertainties). So, “Antifragile” is NOT a theory -- he thinks they’re all crap, (except physics theories – yay, physics! ) let’s just say it’s a mantra or shibboleth -- that you don’t need to know anything to profit from randomness; indeed knowledge itself is inhibiting. But wait, there’s more! In addition to this non-theory, he actually does have a theory that all economists ignore “non-linear” effects that lie at the heart of his Antifragile mantra. Got that? No, nor did I. But he does go on (and on) about non-linear responses, and the “graphs” don’t help. Oh, god, the graphs – they could be anything. Didn’t anyone tell him that the axes at least need labels? It all reminds me of Monty Python’s manic economists: “this graph represents 56% of the population, while this graph represents 73% of the population!”Had he stopped there it would have been a well-meaning but rather incomprehensible rant against conventional economics. But he went on to apply his grand idea to everything else. So the message of this book, if I can condense its 500+ pages, is this: “The World’s a Crazy Place, but someone has to profit. Be one of those people (the AntiFragile)”. That takes about, oh, the first ten pages. The rest is basically one long and repetitive rant against the opposing camp. For in this bipolar world of his, the fragile – the boring and controlling “fragilistas” - are cowed by uncertainty, grasp at the illusion of stability and are generally hostile to the exciting, life-giving antifragile opportunists. The fragile include the dastardly “Soviet-Harvard” system (I did not make that up) that locked him out of academia, and is mentioned more than a few times. They are also suckers that the antifragile can and should take for a ride (this does seem to be a bit too revealing on Taleb’s part).  But, though long and rambling, it is not actually a dull book. For in many places it is unintentionally hilarious. I rolled my eyes many times, and J. did say that she had never heard me laugh out loud at anything connected with economics or politics before – e.g., there is what one could call the Parable of the Women who Marry Economists but have the Love-child of Rock Stars. This was to illustrate the concept that you should be heavily invested in safety but have the audacity to gamble on a long shot that could make you fabulously rich. Provided you did not care about being rich. At least I think that was the message.He is also not a mean person. In fact, he does have his heart in the right place as far as recognizing that certain people need a helping hand in life. But the boundary between legitimate help and smothering control is razor-thin and never defined, and woe betide you if you cross it, you fragilista! I’m talking to you, economist/town planner/big pharma/scientist/academic/soccer mom! Soccer moms?? Yes, you are guilty of “touristification” of your young charges.Taleb loves bathetic lists and invented words like this. I am not sure if they are supposed to be an attempt at humour, but they tend to reveal more about Mr T than anything else. There is a delightful table of various grand human enterprises – science, medicine, education, literature, town planning and so on – and the ills that result from excessive control by the fragilista. My favourite is “literature”, for which the controlling evil is ... “copy editors trying to change your text.\"  Antifragile covers everything - Wisdom of the Ancients, Traditional Ways of Knowing and Grandmothers figure prominently. (These are Grandmothers from the Old Country, not those who were Soccer Moms some 20 years ago, obviously!). So does Fat Tony who at one point has a verbal sparring match with Socrates. (spoiler alert – Fat Tony wins, of course, and that is pure Monty Python). There are also rather too many comparisons showing the Mafia in an uncomfortably favourable light. One such passage contrasts the neurotic persona (typical fragilista) with one who is quietly confident and in control: the antifragile example he uses is a Mafia thug who has just eliminated some 18 of his opponents.  OK, joking aside, it is very easy to mock this bloated book. But the message in AF is profoundly disturbing. As Taleb points out, our complex interconnected society is very definitely fragile, while what he is advocating is only an individual opportunistic response. But it was just this unregulated trading in products that were either not understood (by his venerated Fat Tony) or intentionally misrepresented (by Goldman-Sachs) that was the direct cause of the recent financial chaos and collapse. And Taleb himself recognizes that the financial institutions that he loathes so much were, by his definition, superbly antifragile in the sense that they were handsomely bailed out by the suckers – taxpayers like Mr T. So that makes us all, um, “fragile”. Oops. So in short, this book would be a rather sick prescription for the future if it actually made any sense, and it is a bit depressing that so many seem to have been taken in by Antifragile.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nA truly dreadful text.The author is an extremely poor writer, both in command of language (see \"non-sissy risk\") and in general structure.

I started it, and was enjoying it, but stalled out for some reason. I don’t remember. It was dark. They were big. His book found itself in my lamentably large and scattered collection of partly read books. But somewhere in my mind was the thought of finishing it, which I just did a short time ago. Really glad I did.There are places here and there where you have to tolerate some dogmatic bombast from Taleb—he is the kind of guy, as the saying goes, who is “sometimes wrong, but never in doubt”—but the central thesis of this book is pure gold.Some might want to dismiss his central thesis as a glib attempt to prove that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Taleb knows this, but so did your grandmother. The real point of the book has to do with what toughness actually looks like, how it behaves, how it configures itself before the going gets tough—in short, how does it anticipate the inevitable tough times? And this is where Taleb’s point gets really interesting and is entirely counterintuitive.Institutions, corporations, management systems, biological organisms can be fragile, robust, or antifragile. According to Taleb, fragile systems require predictability. They want the environment to be placid, and they want as much protection as possible from external stressors. Robust systems do okay when they are in trouble; they are resilient. But antifragile systems are complicated, and they positively thrive in the midst of chaos. Chaos is the soil in which they grow and flourish.In peaceful times, a fragile system can give out the appearance of stability, but this is just a mask for the fragility. And because it is easy to be foolish, many people strive for just that appearance. Not many people know that the house built on sand had a five-star rating.“Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it” (Matt. 7:24–27).That’s your fragile system, right there. Two historical examples of fragile systems that did not appear to be at all fragile were the Soviet Union prior to its collapse, and medieval Christendom prior to the Reformation. When subsequent events overtook them—the kind of rare but extreme happening that Taleb calls a Black Swan—their fragility was exposed.Fragile systems are cowardly, and function in a CYA mode much of the time. Because the world is filled with risk, the way that fragile systems manage this is by trying to outsource the risk. But the best way to cultivate an antifragile system is not through recklessness, but by means of a carefully thought-through “skin in the game” approach.A lot of pastors could benefit from gleaning the principles found in this book. They want to build a peaceful church that is free of controversy, and so instead they build a fragile one that is entirely vulnerable to controversy. In the name of fighting off infections, they put their immune system under a ban. The elders issue a chin-stroking statement that antibodies are the troublers of the body.In case anybody is still curious about it, the applications for the Reformed evangelical network in North America are numerous. I can’t tell you how many times I have heard pastors insisting on fragility as though it were one of the fruits of the Spirit. They demand cultivation of fragility as though it were a cardinal virtue. And because this is how the world works, what they have insisted upon they have certainly gotten. Fragility is our middle name. “And he gave them their request; But sent leanness into their soul” (Psalm 106:15). \\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nHere’s probably one of the toughest review I ever had to write and I am not sure it is a good one, even if the topic I am addressing is great and important.

But it’s been a challenge to summarize what I learnt: Nicholas Nassim Taleb gives in this follow-up to the Black Swan a very interesting analysis of how the world can be less exposed to Black Swans, not by becoming more robust only, but by becoming antifragile, i.e. by benefiting from random events. His views include tensions between the individual and the groups, how distributed systems are more robust than centralized ones, how small unites are less fragile than big ones. This does not mean Taleb is against orgamizations, governments or laws as too little intervention induces totally messy situations. It is about putting the cursor at the right level. Switzerland represents for Taleb a good illustration of good state organizations with little central government, a lot of local responsibility. He has similar analogies for the work place, where he explains that an independent worker, who knows well his market, is less fragile to crises than big corporations and their employees. One way to make systems less fragile is to put some noise, some randomness which will stabilize them. This is well-known in science and also in social science. Just remember Athens was randomly nominating some of its leaders to avoid excess!Now let me quote the author. These are notes only but for serious reviews, visit the author’s website, fooledbyrandomness. First Taleb is, as usual, unfair but maybe less than in the Black Swan. Here is an example: “Academics (particularly in social science) seem to distrust each other, […] not to mention a level of envy I have almost never seen in business… My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like “recognition” and “credit” warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry. I grew to find people greedy for credentials nauseating, repulsive, and untrustworthy.” [Page 17] Taleb is right about envy and rivalry but wrong in saying it is worse in academia; I think it is universal! In politics for example. But when money is available, maybe rivalry counts less than where there is little.Now a topic close to my activity: “This message from the ancients is vastly deeper than it seems. It contradicts modern methods and ideas of innovation and progress on many levels, as we tend to think that innovation comes from bureaucratic funding, through central planning, or by putting people through a Harvard Business School class by one Highly Decorated Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (who never innovated anything) or hiring a consultant (who never innovated anything). This is a fallacy – note for now the disproportionate contribution of uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley, and you will see what I mean.” [Page 42] [Extreme and unfair again, even if not fully wrong!]“The antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others. In a system, the sacrifices of some units – fragile units, that is, or people – are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole. The fragility of every start-up is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of the individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate”. [Page 65] What surprised me later is that Taleb shows that this is true of restaurants (not many succeed) as much as of high-tech start-ups. So it is not only about the uncertainty of new markets, but about uncertainty above all. Mathematics of convexityI have to admit Taleb is not easy to read. Not because it is complex (sometimes his ideas are pure common sense), but because it is dense with different even if consistent ideas. The book is divided in 25 chapters, but also in 7 books. In fact, Taleb insists on it, he might have written 7 different books! Even his mathematics is simple. His definition of convexity is a little strange though I found it interested (I teach convex optimization, and you might not know, it was the topic of my PhD!).Jensen inequality is interesting [Pages 342, 227 – Jensen was an amateur mathematician!]– the convex transformation of a mean is less or equal than the mean after convex transformation. Again individual (concave, we die) vs. collective (convex, antifragile, benefits from individual failures). So risk taking is good for collectivity if with insurance mechanisms. Risk taking + insurance vs. speculation with no value added. An example of a short and deep idea: “Decision making is based on payoffs, not knowledge”. [Page 337]“Simply, small probabilities are convex to errors of computation. One needs a parameter, called standard deviation, but uncertainty about standard deviation has the effect of making the small probabilities rise. Smaller and smaller probabilities require more precision in computation. In fact small probabilities are incomputable, even if one has the right model – which we of course don’t.” [Taleb fails to mention Poincare yet he quoted him in the Black Swan, but whatever.]A visible tension between individual and collective interestsQuotes again: “What the economy, as a collective, wants [business school graduates] to do is not to survive, rather to take a lot, a lot of imprudent risks themselves and be blinded by the odds. Their respective industries improve from failure to failure. Natural and nature-like systems want some overconfidence on the part of the individual economic agents, i.e., the overestimation of their chances of success and underestimation of the risks of failure in their business, provided their failure does not impact others. In other words, they want local, but not global overconfidence”. […] In other words, some class of rash, even suicidal, risk taking is healthy for the economy – under the conditions that not all people take the same risks and that these risks remain small and localized. Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other businesses. This is the opposite of healthy risk taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit. […] Nietzsche’s famous expression “what does not kill me makes me stronger” can be easily implemented as meaning Mithridatization or Hormesis but it may also mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but it spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone”. […] This visible tension between individual and collective interests is new in history. […] Some of the ideas about fitness and selection are not very comfortable to this author, which makes the writing of some sections rather painful – I detest the ruthlessness of selection, the inexorable disloyalty of Mother Nature. I detest the notion of improvement thanks to harm to others. As a humanist, I stand against the antifragility of systems at the expense of individuals, for if you follow the reasoning, this makes us humans individually irrelevant. ” [Pages 75-77]A National Entrepreneur Day “Compare the entrepreneurs to the bean-counting managers of companies who climb the ladder of hierarchy with hardly ever any real downside. Their cohort is rarely at risk. My dream – the solution – is that we would have a National Entrepreneur Day, with the following message: Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking and the sacrifices you are making for the sake of the economic growth of the planet and pulling others out of poverty. You are the source of our antifragility. Our nation thanks you.” [Page 80] Local distributed systems, randomness and modernity “You never have a restaurant crisis. Why? Because it is composed of a lot of independent and competing small units that do not individually threaten the system and make it jump from one state to another. Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated.” [Page 98] “Adding a certain number of randomly selected politicians to the process can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system.” [Page 104] “Modernity is the humans’ large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world’s jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors. We are going into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very, very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization, the tax man, fear of the boss…” [Page 108] “Iatrogenics means literally “caused by the healer”. Medical error still currently kills between three times (as accepted by doctors) and ten times as many people as car accidents in the United States, it is generally accepted that harm from doctors – not including risks from hospitals germs – accounts for more deaths than any single cancer. Iatrogenics is compounded by the “agency problem” which emerges when one party (the agent) has personal interested that are divorced from those of the one using his services (the principal). An agency problem is present with the stockbroker and medical doctor whose ultimate interest is their own checking account, not your financial and medical health.” [Pages 111-112] Theories and intervention.“Theories are super-fragile outside physics. The very designation “theory” is even upsetting. In social science, we should call these constructs “chimeras” rather than theories. [Now you understand why Taleb has many enemies.] A main source of the economic crisis started in 2007 in the Iatrogenics of the attempt by […] Alan Greenspan to iron out the “boom-bust” cycle which caused risks to go hide under the carpet. The most depressing part of the Greenspan story is that the fellow was a libertarian and seemingly convinced of the idea of leaving systems to their own devices; people can fool themselves endlessly. […] The argument is not against the notion of intervention; in fact I showed above that I am equally worried about under-intervention when it is truly necessary. […] We have a tendency to underestimate the role of randomness in human affairs. We need to avoid being blinded to the natural antifragility of systems, their ability to take care of themselves and fight our tendency to harm and fragilize them by not giving them a chance to do so. […] Alas, it has been hard for me to fit these ideas about fragility within the current US political discourse. The democratic side of the US spectrum favors hyper-intervention, unconditional regulation and large government, while the Republican side loves large corporations, unconditional deregulation and militarism, both are the same to me here. Let me simplify my take on intervention. To me it is mostly about having a systematic protocol to determine when to intervene and when to leave systems alone. And we may need to intervene to control the iatrogenics of modernity – particularly the large-scale harm to the environment and the concentration of potential (though not yet manifested) damage, the kind of thing we only notice when it is too late. The ideas advanced here are not political, but risk-management based. I do not have a political affiliation or allegiance to a specific party; rather, I am introducing the idea of harm and fragility into the vocabulary so we can formulate appropriate policies to ensure we don’t end up blowing up the planet and ourselves.” [Pages 116-118] “To conclude, the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information. The more data you get, the less you know.” [Page 128] “Political and economic “tail” events are unpredictable and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable.” [Page 133] The barbell strategy and optionality“The Barbell strategy is a way to achieve anti-fragility, by decreasing downside rather than increasing upside, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans. So just as Stoicism is the domestication, not the elimination, of emotions, so is the barbell a domestication, not the elimination, of uncertainty.” [Page 159] “It is a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative, deemed more robust than a monomodal strategy. In biological systems, the equivalent of marrying an accountant and having an occasional fling with a rock star; for a writer, getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.” [Glossary page 428] “The strength of the computer entrepreneur Steve Jobs was precisely in distrusting market research and focus groups – those based on asking people what they want – and following his own imagination, his modus was that people don’t know what they want until you provide them with it.” [Page 171] “America’s asset is simply risk taking and the use of optionality, the remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing, starting again and repeating failure. In modern Japan, by contrast, shame comes, with failure, which causes people to hide risks under the rug, financial or nuclear.”“Nature does a California-style “fail early” – it has an option and uses it. Nature understands optionality effects better than humans. […] The idea is voiced by Steve Jobs in a famous speech: “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” He probably meant “Be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it.” Any trial and error can be seen as the expression of an option, so long as one is capable of identifying a favorable result and exploiting it.” [Page 181] “Option is a substitute for knowledge- actually I don’t understand what sterile knowledge is, since it is necessarily vague and sterile. So I make the bold speculation that many things we think are derived by skill come largely from options, but well-used options, much like Thales’s situation [who had an option with olive presses – pages 173-174] rather than from what we claim to be understanding.” [Page 186] Taleb is skeptical with experts, with anyone believing in a linear model academia -> applied science ->practice (“lecturing birds how to fly”); he believes in tinkering, heuristics, apprenticeship, and makes again many enemies for free! He claims the jet engine, financial derivatives, architecture, medicine were first developed by practitioners and then theorized by scientists, not invented or discovered by them. Tinkering vs. research“There has to be a form of funding that works. By some vicious turn of events, governments have gotten huge payoffs from research, but not as intended – just consider the Internet. It is just that functionaries are too teleological in the way they look for things and so are large corporations. Most large companies, such as Big Pharma, are their own enemies. Consider blue sky research, whereby grants and funding are given to people, not projects, and spread in small amounts across many researchers. It’s been reported that in California, venture capitalists tend to back entrepreneurs, not ideas. Decisions are largely a matter of opinion, strengthened with who you know. Why? Because innovations drift, and one needs flâneur-like abilities to keep capturing the opportunities that arise. The significant venture capital decisions were made without real business plans. So if there was any analysis, it had to be of a backup, confirmatory nature. Visibly the money should go to the tinkerers, the aggressive tinkerers who you trust will milk the option.” [Page 229] “Despite the commercial success of several companies and the stunning growth in revenues for the industry as a whole, most biotechnology firms earn no profit.” [Page 237] [Optionality again]“(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs; (iii) do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.” [Page 238] “I did here just debunk the lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly epiphenomenon and the “linear model”, suing simple mathematical properties of optionality. There Is no empirical evidence to support the statement that organized research in the sense it is currently marketed leads to great things promised by universities. [Cf also Peter Thiel lamentations about the promise of technologies] Education is an institution that has been growing without external stressors; eventually the thing will collapse.” [A conclusion to book IV, page 261] Why is fragility non linear?“For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock. For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).” Via negativa“We may not need a name for or even an ability to express anything. We may just say something about what it is not. Michelangelo was asked by the pope about the secret of his genius, particularly how he carved the statue of David. His answer was: It’s simple, I just remove everything that is not David.” [Page 302-304] […] “Charlatans are recognizable in that they will give you positive advice. Yet in practice, it is the negative that’s used by the pros. One cannot really tell if a successful person has skills, or if a person with skills will succeed – but we can pretty much predict the negative, that a person totally devoid of skills will eventually fail.” […] “The greatest – most robust – contribution to knowledge consist in removing what we think is wrong. We know a lot more what is wrong than what is right. Negative knowledge is more robust to error than positive knowledge. […] Since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it [The Black Swan!], disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. […] Let us say that, in general, failure (and disconfirmation) are more informative than success and confirmation.”[Funnily, I remember the main critics against my book were the lack of [positive] proposal in the end. I should have said there we many about what not to do!]“Finally, consider this modernized version in a saying from Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” [Page 302-304] Less is more“Simpler methods for forecasting and inference can work much, much better than complicated ones. “Fast and frugal” heuristics make good decisions despite limited time. First extreme effects: there are domains in which the rare event (good or bad) plays a disproportionate share and we tend to be blind to it. Just worry about Black Swan exposures and life is easy. There may not be an easily identifiable cause for a large share of the problems, but often there is an easy solution, sometimes with the naked eye rather than the use of the complicated analyses. Yet people want more data to solve problems.” [Page 305-306]... more on my blog...\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat a self-centered jerk with an overly simplistic premise.

Obviously an allusion to the famous story in which a gentile promises to convert if Rabbi Hillel can explain Judaism while standing on one foot, Taleb offers, \"the best way to verify if you are alive is to check whether you like variations.\" I\\'ll admit at the beginning of this review: there were sections of this book I had to skip. More on why in a bit.Taleb\\'s thesis is that modernity is the attempt of human beings to turn the random into the predictable and stable, and that this attempt ironically causes MORE randomness and disorder. Taleb demonstrates that in evolution, economics, philosophy, ethics, politics and elsewhere, the \"Antifragile,\" things which BENEFIT and get STRONGER due to stressors are the rule, not the exception. He believes that modernity, and our attempts to make our lives predictable and orderly only bring FRAGILITY, which either gets WEAKER with stressors or at best, barely survives stressors intact.This seems very compelling. Given my personal medical history as a Crohn\\'s sufferer who has undergone five surgeries, the prospect that all of this suffering is actually making me STRONGER and more resilient rather than broken and weaker is inspiring. Taleb doesn\\'t pretend that this theory is novel; indeed, much of his evidence is derived from ancient and classical wisdom and cultures. He notes that the maxim \"what doesn\\'t kill you makes you stronger,\" isn\\'t NEW, just that it\\'s almost completely ignored by policy makers, economists, parents who try to protect their children from all harm, and his previous colleagues in risk management positions.HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I find Taleb\\'s tone and style incredibly off-putting. It\\'s clear that he has an axe to grind with Ivy League educated leaders and policy makers. He even coins a particularly destructive pattern of fragile thought \"Harvard/Soviet\" something or other. In constantly trying to position himself as an Everyman speaking in the voice \"Fat Tony\" from Brooklyn, Taleb fails at every turn to NOT sound like an arrogant, long winded, elitist. Anyone whose short bio on the back flap describes him as \"a flaneur meditating in cafes,\" is going to have trouble connecting with the reader. Don\\'t be ashamed, I had to look up \"flaneur\" as well. It\\'s someone who spends his or her time WALKING in a meditative and philosophical manner in the spirit of Montaigne. Wow. Another reviewer, who actually LIKED the book, described Taleb as an asshole. Unlike her, I find his personal \"ass-holier-than-thou-ness\" inseparable from his argument.So Taleb is QUITE in love with the sound of his own voice and his verbosity, intentionally obscure chapter titles, and inability to maintain a straightforward argument free of bombast is the reason I found it impossible to read this book from cover to cover. Perhaps the problem is as simple as this: Taleb\\'s central thesis about antifragility is written on the cover. It\\'s interesting. It\\'s a compelling idea. And really, Taleb could have devoted 35 concentrated pages advising us how to better embrace random events and stressors (Black Swans he calls them in his previous book) at work, in raising our children, and with regard to our own health. That would have been a five star endeavor and could have appeared as a lengthy New Yorker feature. But the room that a book length work gives Taleb to stretch out his legs is to his detriment. He is in dire need of editor unafraid to be called \"too stupid to understand\" to rein in his oversized ego and overwrought style.I am left interested and disappointed. Not a pleasant feeling after devoting so much time and concentration following Taleb\\'s circuitous verbal \"flaneur-ing.\"\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nA horrid book. I really looked forward to this book, but beyond the central concept of how there are things which become better/ strengthen in the face of adversity, and how they ought to be termed \\'antifragile\\' - the book has very little to offer.I think the book ought to have been worth 50 odd pages; in the end, it\\'s a very badly written book that is difficult to follow.\\n\\n \\n\\nI wanted to like this, but found it inscrutably long winded and obnoxiously dull. What is the practical takeaway? Adaptability is preferable to overly complex systems that break down? Why didn\\'t I think of that?!\\n\\n \\n\\nI\\'m predisposed to like new ideas, unexpected outcomes, and even a bit of irreverence. But after just 13 pages of Taleb\\'s narcissistic, contrarian-for-contrarianism\\'s-sake drivel, I decided I had better things to do with my life.\\n\\n \\n\\nDon\\'t waste you time.

Makes some good points about unintended consequences, difficulties of top-down intervention/control when the system is highly complex and reacts in nonlinear, hard-to-predict fashion, etc.So why only one star? B/c the book was so annoying I was unable to finish it. The persona of the author was more prominent than in the average blog or diary, and not in an agreeable way. His self-image as a contrarian, rebel, willing to say what no one else will, physically tough compared to wimpy academics, etc. is pushed constantly. Almost read like a Saturday Night Live parody -- the Man Who Was Right about Everything stuck in a World of Cowardly, Physically Inferior Fools.\\n...more\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat hilariously self-important hypocrisy!

Basically, we need to embrace certain kinds of shocks and risks and that developing anti-fragility is key. I also wholeheartedly agree with his whole section on medicine and and drug interventions. But the nuggets of useful advice are delivered in a shit sandwich of anti-intellectualism, cockiness and so much snark. He hates \"fragilistas\" and basically all academics, especially economists. And don\\'t get me wrong--academics are super petty and often wrong. But then he goes on to make his case by citing a ton of academic research and studies (some done by him and co-authors). So it\\'s not academics he hates--it\\'s anyone who disagrees with him. Then there\\'s the absurd self-regard. The part where I laughed out loud was not when he said he could bench press 330 and looked like a bodyguard, it\\'s when he imagines a dialogue with socrates and he totally stumps him! Oh and no one understands Seneca the way Taleb does. Also, he and he alone (and I guess his fat Jersey trader buddies) all predicted the financial crisis. HHe hates every body except \"real men\" who are business bros. He definitely hates soccer moms. In fact, I think this can best be lumped in with all the other screeds against \"feminization\" and if you read \"academic\" as \"girly men,\" this book just sounds like a schoolyard taunt and a chest thumping screed that we stop being sissies and go back to the world where we were all real men. And you knew he\\'d be all about cross fit and paleo, right? It\\'s too bad because I really did like his other books Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan.\\n...more\\n\\n'"
